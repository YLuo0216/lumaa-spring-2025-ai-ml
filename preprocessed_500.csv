Saratoga Trunk,drama,"In 1875, Clio Dulaine (Ingrid Bergman), the illegitimate daughter of an aristocratic New Orleans French Creole father and a light-skinned Creole woman of color who was his placée, returns from Paris to her birthplace in Rampart Street to avenge her mother's mistreatment at the hands of her father's family, the Dulaines. Years ago, Clio's mother accidentally killed Dulaine when he tried to prevent her from committing suicide, and the scandalized Dulaines then exiled Clio and her mother to Paris. Clio is accompanied by her Haitian maid, Angelique (Flora Robson), and her dwarf manservant, Cupidon (Jerry Austin).
After fixing up the rundown house in Rampart Street, Clio ventures out, hoping to encounter the Dulaines, now comprising her father's widow, the widow's mother, and the widow's daughter (and Clio's half-sister) Charlotte Thérèse. At the French marketplace, Clio stops for a bowl of jambalaya and is immediately attracted to Clint Maroon (Gary Cooper), a tall Texan in a white hat, who is eating at the counter. The attraction is mutual, and Clint offers to drive Clio to the cathedral in his carriage, but a disapproving Angelique interferes, and Clio leaves without him. After the service, Clio, Angelique, and Cupidon breakfast at Begue's, the restaurant patronized by the Dulaines every Sunday. Announcing to the maitre d' that she is a relative, Clio sits at the table reserved for the Dulaines, but when the Dulaines arrive, they recognize her by her resemblance to her mother and leave without a confrontation. Clint and Clio meet again at the restaurant, and afterward he drives her home.
Soon after, Clio and Clint begin a courtship. Eventually, Clint moves into Clio's house. Although they are in love with each other, Clio, who is obsessed with her plans for revenge, intends to marry a rich and powerful man to prove that she is as good as her father's family. Clint, a gambler, who never intends to marry, is out for revenge against the railroaders who ruined his father in Texas.
Clio continues to embarrass the Dulaines at every opportunity, planning, if necessary, to sabotage the society debut of her half-sister Charlotte Thérèse. Exasperated by Clio's unrelenting machinations, Clint leaves for Saratoga Springs, New York. As the result of Clio's scheming, the Dulaines pay her $10,000 and agree to destroy the Rampart Street house and bury her mother in a New Orleans cemetery. Later, Clio joins Clint in Saratoga Springs, where she plots to marry wealthy railroad heir Bartholomew Van Steed (John Warburton). Clio's arrival with Angelique and Cupidon causes quite a stir, and because the hotel is completely booked, Clint, who is now calling himself Colonel Maroon, offers Clio two of the rooms in his suite. Privately, he explains that Bart owns a railroad, the Saratoga Trunk, which is suddenly worth millions of dollars because it connects the coal country with New York.
Railroader Raymond Soule (Louis Payne), the same man who ruined Clint's father, is trying to steal the railroad from Bart. Clio poses as the widow of a French count, a claim that many doubt until she is unexpectedly backed up by socialite Mrs. Coventry Bellop (Florence Bates), who intensely dislikes Van Steed's mother. Clio's beauty and melodramatic posturing quickly capture Bart's attentions.
Meanwhile, Clint offers to save the Saratoga Trunk from Soule in exchange for shares in the railroad. When Clio learns that Bart is paying Clint to do his dirty work, she hysterically accuses him of cowardice and sends him away. This excites Bart, who explains that he knows about her background, but wants to marry her anyway. The costume ball that evening is interrupted by the arrival of Clint and Cupidon, who were seriously wounded during a pitched battle with Soule's men. Clio realizes that she loves Clint too much to marry another man and nurses him back to health. Clint then tells Clio that, having saved the Saratoga Trunk from Soule, his railroad shares have made him a very rich man, and he plans to eventually take over the trunk line himself from Van Steed.",drama clio dulaine ingrid bergman illegitimate daughter aristocratic new orleans french creole father light skin creole woman color placée return paris birthplace rampart street avenge mother mistreatment hand father family dulaine year ago clio mother accidentally kill dulaine try prevent commit suicide scandalize dulaine exile clio mother paris clio accompany haitian maid angelique flora robson dwarf manservant cupidon jerry austin fix rundown house rampart street clio venture hope encounter dulaine comprise father widow widow mother widow daughter clio half sister charlotte thérèse french marketplace clio stop bowl jambalaya immediately attract clint maroon gary cooper tall texan white hat eat counter attraction mutual clint offer drive clio cathedral carriage disapprove angelique interfere clio leave service clio angelique cupidon breakfast begue restaurant patronize dulaine sunday announce maitre d relative clio sit table reserve dulaine dulaine arrive recognize resemblance mother leave confrontation clint clio meet restaurant afterward drive home soon clio clint begin courtship eventually clint move clio house love clio obsess plan revenge intend marry rich powerful man prove good father family clint gambler intend marry revenge railroader ruin father texas clio continue embarrass dulaine opportunity planning necessary sabotage society debut half sister charlotte thérèse exasperate clio unrelenting machination clint leave saratoga spring new york result clio scheming dulaine pay agree destroy rampart street house bury mother new orleans cemetery later clio join clint saratoga spring plot marry wealthy railroad heir bartholomew van steed john warburton clio arrival angelique cupidon cause stir hotel completely book clint call colonel maroon offer clio room suite privately explain bart own railroad saratoga trunk suddenly worth million dollar connect coal country new york railroader raymond soule louis payne man ruin clint father try steal railroad bart clio pose widow french count claim doubt unexpectedly back socialite mrs coventry bellop florence bate intensely dislike van steed mother clio beauty melodramatic posturing quickly capture bart attention clint offer save saratoga trunk soule exchange share railroad clio learn bart pay clint dirty work hysterically accuse cowardice send away excite bart explain know background want marry costume ball evening interrupt arrival clint cupidon seriously wound pitched battle soule man clio realize love clint marry man nurse health clint tell clio having save saratoga trunk soule railroad share rich man plan eventually trunk line van steed

Broken Strings,drama,"Concert violinist Arthur Williams (Clarence Muse) and his manager Earl Wells (Earle Morris) are involved in a car accident in which Arthur's fingers are paralyzed. Instead of playing at concerts he becomes a music teacher. He favors his student Dickie Morley's (Matthew ""Stymie"" Beard) classical musical preferences over his own son John's (William Washington), which tends towards modern swing.
Arthur's daughter Grace (Sybil Lewis) is romantically interested in a man named Gus (Pete Webster), and they both work for the same company that makes hair products, which is owned by a James Stilton. Stilton's son, Sam (Edward Thompson), has a thing for grace and is jealous of the attention she gives Gus. As a result, Sam refuses to give Grace an advance when she needs to pay for her father's appointment at a doctor that specializes in neurology, Dr. Charles Matson (Jess Lee Brooks). The doctor promises Grace that she can pay the fee of $1,000 later, when her brother John has raised the money.
Sam goes on to frame Gus for something he didn't do, and when Gus finds out, both he and Grace quit their jobs at the Stilton company. Fortunately, Johnny is a big success at the Miller Café when he is playing swing.
Arthur is mad and chastizes his son for playing such, in his view, awful music, and punishes him by making him play the violin until he faints. Soon after, Grace tells her father that Johnny only played at the club so that they could pay for the neurologist and support themselves since she is currently between jobs. Arthur feels guilt over how he treated his son.
Johnny and Grace go on to enter a music contest broadcast on the radio. At first it looks like their performance will be stopped when two strings on his violin, but then he gets the idea to play swing, since there are enough strings for that. The rest of the radio musicians all start playing the same way, and the performance is a success. When his son wins the contest, Arthur realizes his talent, and starts to regain sensitivity enough in his fingers to applause his son. Later it turns out that Dickie had sabotaged the violin before the contest, for which he apologizes. Arthur continues his career as a violinist.[1]",drama concert violinist arthur williams clarence muse manager earl wells earle morris involve car accident arthur finger paralyze instead play concert music teacher favor student dickie morley matthew stymie beard classical musical preference son john william washington tend modern swing arthur daughter grace sybil lewis romantically interested man name gus pete webster work company make hair product own james stilton stilton son sam edward thompson thing grace jealous attention give gus result sam refuse grace advance need pay father appointment doctor specialize neurology dr charles matson jess lee brooks doctor promise grace pay fee later brother john raise money sam go frame gus gus find grace quit job stilton company fortunately johnny big success miller café play swing arthur mad chastize son play view awful music punish make play violin faint soon grace tell father johnny play club pay neurologist support currently job arthur feel guilt treat son johnny grace enter music contest broadcast radio look like performance stop string violin get idea play swing string rest radio musician start play way performance success son win contest arthur realize talent start regain sensitivity finger applause son later turn dickie sabotage violin contest apologize arthur continue career
One Got Fat,educational,"In the film, ten children, nine of whom have monkey faces, hats and tails, plan on going to the park for a picnic. They all ride there on their bikes together on the nine-block journey (all except one, whose bicycle was stolen and who instead had to run to keep up with his friends); seeing that one of their friends has a basket, they decide to have him carry all of their lunches to the park. Each one of the monkeys has a character flaw, and each disobeys a specific rule that prevents them from reaching the park. At each block, one of the monkeys is eliminated from the group because of the consequences of their disobedience—usually by way of a collision. In the end, only one of the friends (who not only followed all the bike safety rules, but is also a normal human, whose face is not shown until the very end) makes it to the park and, because he was the one with the basket, gets all of his friends' food to himself, even though he doesn't want it all. Thus, as the title says, ""One got fat!"" Three of the monkeys are seen in hospital beds.
In contrast to other social guidance films, One Got Fat is a dark comedy.",educational film child monkey face hat tail plan go park picnic ride bike block journey bicycle steal instead run friend see friend basket decide carry lunch park monkey character flaw disobey specific rule prevent reach park block monkey eliminate group consequence disobedience usually way collision end friend follow bike safety rule normal human face show end make park basket get friend food want title say get fat monkey see hospital bed contrast social guidance film get fat dark comedy
Straight to Hell,action,"The film opens with three hitmen, Willy, Norwood, and Simms (played by Dick Rude, Sy Richardson, and Joe Strummer, respectively) who are staying in a posh Los Angeles hotel. After failing a job, they take off in a car with a whiny pregnant woman named Velma (Courtney Love), who is in on their scheme. They then flee to Mexico to escape the wrath of their boss, Amos Dade (Jim Jarmusch), and rob a bank along the way. While driving through the desert, their car breaks down due to Simms having filled the gasoline tank with diesel by mistake. They bury their suitcase of money in the desert and begin to walk.
Night falls, and they come upon a town in the middle of the desert, where they see a demolished car with a corpse inside. They then enter an empty bar, where the three men get drunk and Velma angrily pesters them to leave. As they exit the bar, the wrecked car has vanished, but the men are too inebriated to notice it. The group camps out for the night, and the following morning, Velma witnesses several trucks of lively cowboys enter the town, carrying espresso machines with them. Much to the dismay of Velma, who insists they keep a low profile and leave, the three men enter the town, which is now full of townspeople, and go back to the bar.
There, they are confronted by a gang of cowboys addicted to coffee (The Pogues), and a shoot-out ensues, but they are ultimately welcomed by the townspeople. The bizarre townspeople include a couple who own a mercantile full of piñatas, a man running a hot dog stand, and countless cowboys and prostitutes, among others. The head honcho of the town, Tim McMahon (Biff Yeager), invites the gang to a party that evening. The following day, Tim McMahon's elderly father is pushed off of a building by his relative Sabrina McMahon (Kathy Burke) and dies. The entire town has a funeral procession for him, and at the funeral, a friend of Amos', named Whitey, shows up looking for the hitmen and Velma.
The town seizes Whitey for being a ""stranger"", and accuses him of the murder of the McMahon grandfather. During the burial of the grandfather, his hand comes up out of the dirt and grabs the priest's ankle, and the priest shoots into the ground, killing him. Meanwhile, on the gallows, Whitey begins to tell the town the truth about Amos and the hitmen, but is hanged before he can tell his story. A man named I.G. Farben (Dennis Hopper), who claims to be a house manufacturer, enters town with his wife Sonia (Grace Jones) and introduces himself to the gang and the rest of the townspeople, advertising his company. The next morning, Simms sees Amos' car enter the town, and tries to get a drunken Willy and Norwood to leave with Velma.
A series of shootouts begin between the townspeople, Amos' crew, and the hitmen, and I.G. Farben and Sonia provide high-grade weapons for the killers. Tim McMahon joins Amos' team after having wrongfully hanged Whitey, and everyone begins to turn against each other. As Simms and Willy run into the desert, a shootout ensues with the town priest. They reach the spot where they buried the money, and Simms shoots Willy as they are trying to lift the suitcase out of the ground. Simms then hears Velma laughing, and turns around only to be shot by Velma and one of the townsmen. After Velma shoots Simms several times, the townman with her is shot by Tim McMahon. Tim and Velma then take off arm-in-arm with the suitcase of money, while Simms and Willy die.
Meanwhile, in town, chaos has ensued, and the town hardware store is set on fire. Amos is shot in the head, and virtually everyone in the town is killed, aside from Norwood and several prostitutes. Tim and Velma leave the town in a truck with the suitcase of money, but accidentally drive off of a cliff when their brakes go out, and die as the car explodes in mid-air. Norwood leaves town with the prostitutes, and the film ends with Farben Oil Company trucks entering the town to drill for oil.
The end of the film announces an imminent sequel: Back to Hell, despite the fact that almost every main character is killed at the end of the film. Although the sequel was never made, upon the film's DVD release, Cox reassembled much of the cast and crew for a short documentary called Back to Hell, in which they reminisce about the making of the film.",action film open hitman willy norwood simms play dick rude sy richardson joe strummer respectively stay posh los angeles hotel fail job car whiny pregnant woman name velma courtney love scheme flee mexico escape wrath boss amos dade jim jarmusch rob bank way drive desert car break simms having fill gasoline tank diesel mistake bury suitcase money desert begin walk night fall come town middle desert demolish car corpse inside enter bar man drunk velma angrily pester leave exit bar wreck car vanish man inebriated notice group camp night follow morning velma witness truck lively cowboy enter town carry espresso machine dismay velma insist low profile leave man enter town townspeople bar confront gang cowboy addict coffee pogue shoot ensue ultimately welcome townspeople bizarre townspeople include couple mercantile piñata man run hot dog stand countless cowboy prostitute head honcho town tim mcmahon biff yeager invite gang party evening follow day tim mcmahon elderly father push building relative sabrina mcmahon kathy burke die entire town funeral procession funeral friend amos name whitey show look hitman velma town seize whitey strange accuse murder mcmahon grandfather burial grandfather hand come dirt grab priest ankle priest shoot ground kill gallow whitey begin tell town truth amos hitman hang tell story man name farben dennis hopper claim house manufacturer enter town wife sonia grace jones introduce gang rest townspeople advertise company morning simms see amos car enter town try drunken willy norwood leave velma series shootout begin townspeople amos crew hitman farben sonia provide high grade weapon killer tim mcmahon join amos team having wrongfully hang whitey begin turn simms willy run desert shootout ensue town priest reach spot bury money simms shoot willy try lift suitcase ground simms hear velma laughing turn shoot velma townsman velma shoot simms time townman shoot tim mcmahon tim velma arm arm suitcase money simms willy die town chaos ensue town hardware store set fire amos shoot head virtually town kill aside norwood prostitute tim velma leave town truck suitcase money accidentally drive cliff brake die car explode mid air norwood leave town prostitute film end farben oil company truck enter town drill oil end film announce imminent sequel hell despite fact main character kill end film sequel film dvd release cox reassemble cast crew short documentary call hell reminisce making film
El Madina (The City),drama,"In the center of El-Madina lives Ali, a young man who wants to act but is unable to find proper work. The only escape for his creative instincts, besides nightly conversations with a poster of Robert De Niro’s Raging Bull, is occasional bottom-of-the-line stage melodramas. Ali makes money as a butchers’ accountant in his neighborhood’s souq, where his father is a vegetable vendor. This quarter, Rod al-Faraj, is emblematic of a number of inner city neighborhoods in Cairo, which have been erased, and isolated their residents to desert suburbs by an Egyptian government, wanting to restore its historic monuments and attract tourists. Throughout the film, there’s a point at which Ali’s souq, slotted for tourist gentrification, is shut by the Egyptian internal security. He finally decides to escape Egypt and pursue acting in France. Two years later we do find him acting, not on stage but in the boxing ring. Unable to find legal work, he has fallen in with a fellow countryman who pays him to “throw” fights in crooked boxing matches. Ali is again stripped of his livelihood. After his business is forcibly absorbed by French gangsters, Ali’s partner betrays him and flees to Egypt, leaving him penniless and without an identity. Ultimately the actor finds himself back in Rod al-Faraj, having to start his life quite literally from scratch.[4]",drama center el madina live ali young man want act unable find proper work escape creative instinct nightly conversation poster robert de niro rage bull occasional line stage melodrama ali make money butcher accountant neighborhood souq father vegetable vendor quarter rod al faraj emblematic number inner city neighborhood cairo erase isolate resident desert suburb egyptian government want restore historic monument attract tourist film point ali souq slot tourist gentrification shut egyptian internal security finally decide escape egypt pursue act france year later find act stage boxing ring unable find legal work fall fellow countryman pay throw fight crooked boxing match ali strip livelihood business forcibly absorb french gangster ali partner betray flee egypt leave penniless identity ultimately actor find rod al faraj have start life literally

The Next of Kin,war/drama,"The British are preparing a secret raid on the German-held French coastal village of Norville, where a lightly defended submarine base has been newly set up. Major Richards is assigned as the security officer for the 95th Brigade, the unit chosen for the task. German intelligence learns that the 95th are being moved to Westport for training for some mission via Miss Clare, an attractive showgirl who has a talkative admirer in Lieutenant Cummins.
They send agents 23 and 16 to England to discover the intended target by piecing together information from different sources, including conversations overheard in pubs, railway stations, shops and other public places. 16 is caught when he claims to be a soldier with the same company as Private Durnford, but 23 reaches his contact, Mr Barratt, a bookseller at Westport. When Richards spots Miss Clare in a pub in Westport having a drink with Cummins, he has the police search her belongings, not expecting them to find anything. However, they discover spy equipment and she is arrested. Agent 23 witnesses this and departs hastily, having already come to the attention of Richards. Barratt assigns him to 16's job, to infiltrate an ordnance depot. After he helps an ATS driver with a punctured tyre, she invites him to a dance. There he learns that the 95th have top priority for special equipment.
Certain that the mission is imminent and without any agents to spare, Barratt forces his employee, Dutch refugee Beppie Leemans, to take on the task of finding out where and when the 95th are going from her soldier boyfriend in exchange for the safety of her parents in German-occupied Holland. She informs him that the 95th are expecting aerial photographs. Barratt sends 23 to London to contact another agent to try to obtain the photographs. When Leemans realises the seriousness of what she has done, she stabs Barratt to death, but 23 returns unexpectedly and knocks her out. He then turns on the gas and makes it look like a murder–suicide. An agent manages to steal the briefcase containing an aerial negative, carelessly left unattended at a cafe by a wing commander. The officer believes his briefcase was taken by mistake and is relieved when it is returned to the cafe (after a photograph is developed). The photograph is smuggled to German intelligence and used to identify the 95th's objective. As a result, the Germans are waiting in ambush.
Originally, the commando raid depicted was intended to be a complete failure. However, the War Office were uncomfortable about showing such a defeat. In the final version, the raid is successful, albeit with heavy losses. Winston Churchill reportedly wanted the film banned as a threat to morale, but was eventually persuaded of the importance of its message.
Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne appear in cameos at the end of the film as two ""careless talkers"" on a train, in the same compartment as 23. The two men made many appearances together in British films of the 1940s, following their successful pairing as ""Charters and Caldicott"" in Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.",war drama british prepare secret raid german hold french coastal village norville lightly defend submarine base newly set major richard assign security officer brigade unit choose task german intelligence learn move westport training mission miss clare attractive showgirl talkative admirer lieutenant cummin send agent england discover intended target piece information different source include conversation overhear pub railway station shop public place catch claim soldier company private durnford reach contact mr barratt bookseller westport richard spot miss clare pub westport have drink cummin police search belonging expect find discover spy equipment arrest agent witness depart hastily having come attention richard barratt assign job infiltrate ordnance depot help ats driver punctured tyre invite dance learn priority special equipment certain mission imminent agent spare barratt force employee dutch refugee beppie leemans task find go soldier boyfriend exchange safety parent german occupy holland inform expect aerial photograph barratt send london contact agent try obtain photograph leeman realise seriousness stab barratt death return unexpectedly knock turn gas make look like murder suicide agent manage steal briefcase contain aerial negative carelessly leave unattended cafe wing commander officer believe briefcase take mistake relieve return cafe photograph develop photograph smuggle german intelligence identify objective result germans wait ambush originally commando raid depict intend complete failure war office uncomfortable show defeat final version raid successful albeit heavy loss winston churchill reportedly want film ban threat morale eventually persuade importance message basil radford naunton wayne appear cameo end film careless talker train compartment man appearance british film follow successful pairing charter caldicott hitchcock lady vanishe

Hell Divers,"drama, adventure","Leading Chief Petty Officer ""Windy"" Riker (Wallace Beery)[Note 2] is a veteran aerial gunner of a Navy Helldiver dive bomber and the leading chief of Fighting Squadron One, about to go to Panama aboard the USS Saratoga aircraft carrier. He loses his five-year title of ""champion machine gunner"" after young C.P.O. Steve Nelson (Clark Gable) joins the squadron. Windy, notorious for using his fists to enforce discipline, is charged by local police with wrecking a Turkish bath. Windy is saved from arrest, however, when Lieutenant Commander Jack Griffin (John Miljan), skipper of the squadron, intervenes on his behalf. Griffin and his second-in-command, Lieutenant ""Duke"" Johnson (Conrad Nagel), agree that Nelson is the best candidate to replace Windy as he ponders retirement.
The chiefs engage in friendly rivalry until the squadron practices a new dive-bombing technique and Steve becomes a hero, saving the base from being accidentally bombed by climbing out on the wing of his dive bomber to hold in place a bomb that failed to release. Feelings turn bitter when Steve contradicts Windy's explanation of the accident and Windy punches him in resentment. Windy is dressed down by Duke when the officer sees the punch. When Steve's sweetheart, Ann Mitchell (Dorothy Jordan), visits him, he proposes marriage to her, but Windy uses a practical joke to get even with Steve. Unaware that Ann is Steve's fiancee and not simply a girl he is trying to impress, Windy bribes an old acquaintance, Lulu (Marie Prevost), to pretend to be Steve's outraged lover. Ann leaves upset and will not listen to Steve's denials.
Griffin loses an arm following a mid-air collision at night. The accident occurs when the aircraft are returning from delivering the admiral and his flag to the Saratoga before the squadron embarks.[Note 3] Griffin is retired and replaced in command of Fighting One by Duke Johnson. Windy becomes Johnson's gunner when the squadron flies to the ship. During a bombing exercise off Panama, Windy misplaces his code book and delays the takeoff of the squadron. As punishment, he is assigned to supervise a work party when the ship docks, missing liberty and keeping him from seeing Mame Kelsey (Rambeau), the woman in Panama he wants to settle down with after retirement.
Steve, who knows Mame, encounters her on the dock and shares her carriage, but Windy hears about it and sneaks into town. Mame tries to convince Steve to patch up his differences with Windy, then promotes peace between them when Windy shows up at her hotel. Having a drink together in the bar, however, Windy starts a brawl. Steve tries to help him avoid the local police but Windy is thrown in jail. As the Saratoga passes through the Panama Canal, Mame bails Windy out of jail and he catches up to it by stealing a boat. For his transgressions, the captain of the Saratoga reduces Windy one rate from chief. Windy is disciplined at ""Captain's Mast"" and reduced to Aviation Machinist's Mate 1st Class for leaving his post without authorization, absent without leave, and missing ship. Steve reluctantly becomes leading chief.
During a mock battle, Steve's aircraft crashes near a rocky island, killing the pilot and leaving Steve with a broken leg. Duke and Windy land to rescue Steve, but Duke suffers a head injury and Windy has to save both. They have only a radio receiver and cannot be found in the fog. Steve and Windy become friends while waiting for rescue. Windy writes Ann a note confessing what he did with Lulu. After four days, Duke's condition worsens, Steve develops blood poisoning, and they hear on the radio that the Saratoga is leaving. Windy tries to save them by flying them out in Duke's dive bomber, with Duke in the rear cockpit and Steve riding on the wing. Despite the fog, they find the aircraft carrier, but crash on landing and Windy is fatally injured.

Friend Request,horror,"Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey) is one of the most popular students at her college and enjoys an active social life with many friends and family members. She is active on social networks and has over 800 friends on Facebook. She lives with three friends, Olivia (Brit Morgan), Isabel (Brooke Markham) and Gustavo (Sean Marquette). She is also close friends with Kobe (Connor Paolo) and is dating Tyler (William Moseley).
Laura receives a friend request from a student at her campus, Marina Mills. Seeing her talents in animation, she accepts the request and begins a friendship with the lonely girl. However she soon notices that Marina's Facebook profile is plastered in bizarre and disturbing images and her obsessive behavior begins to make Laura feel uncomfortable. When Laura shares pictures of herself at her birthday dinner – to which Marina was not invited – Marina publicly and angrily confronts her at her college campus. During the quarrel, Laura accidentally pushes Marina and her hat falls off, revealing her bald spot, a result of trichotillomania, causing Marina to run away. Laura notices Marina's several comments, who tries to apologize to her, Laura eventually unfriends Marina on Facebook. Seeing her number of friends once again down to zero, a heartbroken Marina angrily closes her laptop. That night, Laura notices a black mirror, which shows a forest where a dark figure is seen walking. As Laura is staring at it, a terrifying demonic face appears behind her, but quickly disappears when Olivia turns on the light. In the next morning, teacher reveals that Marina has committed suicide, much to Laura's astonishment.
Another night, Marina uploads a video, showing she burns the drawing of Laura and commits suicide by hanging herself, terrifying Laura.
The next morning, Laura receives a message from Marina containing the video of her suicide. Later on, it is posted to her Facebook page. Laura is unable to remove the video, and her friend count drops. Left with no choice, she tries to delete her account, but an unknown error occurs. Realizing that she is being stalked, Laura goes to Kobe's apartment for help. When Kobe and Laura investigate Marina's Facebook page, they realize that the source code where it has been written is not the normal code.
That night, Marina adds Gustavo as a friend and posts a distorted picture of his face. The lights suddenly cut off, he is then terrorized by a spirit, while seeing things that were posted on Marina's page. Gustavo rushes into the elevator for safety, only to be attacked by a swarm of wasps; as the elevator doors opens, he is seen smashing his face against the elevator walls by an unseen force, and is discovered by Isabelle, who was sent to a hospital and begins to blame Laura for Gustavo's death.
The recorded video of the elevator attack is posted on Laura's Facebook page. Her friends subsequently turn against her by posting angry and disgusted comments, effectively making her an outcast. Laura attempts to text her friends that she didn't, but to her confusion, the texts suddenly changes to ""u will know what it feels like to be lonely :)"". Laura goes to the orphanage where she meets the woman, who reveals that Marina's real last name is Nedifar; Marina was ruthlessly bullied and tormented by the boys when she was seven-years old. However, they were murdered by an unknown assailant. Meanwhile, Kobe is looking for the black mirror on a website. Suddenly, several faces of Marina appear on the monitors as the lights begin flickering, but everything quickly reverts when the janitor arrives.
A devastated Isabelle is going through pictures on her phone, she begins hallucinating and notices the burnt body of a woman and rushes to get help but finds that nobody is there. Horrified after seeing the two boys with their mutilated faces coming toward her, she rushes into the bathroom and locks herself. To make matters worse, she finds the body of herself before being killed by Marina. Laura goes with Detective Cameron and his officer to watch the recorded footage of Isabelle which showed that the hospital staff were there revealing that she was hallucinating and slits her own throat out of madness, controlled by Marina. The footage was later posted on Laura's Facebook page. Tyler, Kobe and Olivia are unable to delete the videos, unfriend Laura or deactivate their account as unknown errors keep occurring, Laura's Facebook friend count continues to drop, while Tyler is looking the address of Marina's home. Olivia separated with Laura and moved out, fearing that she would share the same fate as Gustavo and Isabelle. Later, Laura notices the picture of Olivia from Marina's page, the picture slowly melts, implying that she is next. Laura attempts to call her, but Olivia has turned off her phone, alongside laptop. Olivia is attacked by Marina with wasps and taken into the hospital. When Tyler and Detective Cameron are talking, Marina possesses Olivia through the heart monitor and lunges at detective Cameron's partner, taking the gun from him. Instead of shooting the officer, she shoots herself in the head, killing Olivia.
Meanwhile, Laura hunts down the place where Marina committed suicide in order to destroy the black mirror that turned Marina into an evil spirit, she and Kobe go to Marina's house which was burnt down and attempt to look for her. While there, Kobe sees an ethereal entity come out of the basement and approaches him, but disappears when Laura bumps into him. Laura tells him that Marina is not there, but he suggests that they look in the basement.
Marina is not found in the basement, but while searching, Kobe is separated from Laura, who finds him staring into a black mirror. When she turns him around and asks what's wrong, he apologizes to Laura and says that she can't be lonely if she died. Kobe suddenly stabs her in the stomach, hoping to kill her in order to save himself and Tyler. Laura hits him with her flashlight and escapes from the basement as Kobe gives the chase but loses her. Laura then realizes through one of Marina's posts that Marina committed suicide in one of the nearby factories.
Meanwhile, Tyler finds a deranged Kobe looking for Laura. After getting a call, Tyler and Kobe head to the factories as well, but he tells Kobe to stay in the car while he tried to find Laura. Once getting to the factories, a wounded Laura starts looking for Marina's body, she receives a video call from her mother, Caroline, who informs that she's been seeing Marina too. Laura's video call begins to glitch out as her mother begins to act strangely, a sign that she may be attacked by Marina. Caroline takes a knife from the table and goes to the other room, presumably killing herself as the connection times out. Devastated by her mother's presumed death, Laura begins to cry after seeing everyone she's loved being taken away. Tyler soon finds her, only their reunion is cut short when Kobe appears and stabs Tyler in the throat, killing him. Laura attempts to escape Kobe once again but reaches a dead end. However, before he can kill Laura, Kobe is violently attacked and killed by the pack of wasps.
Laura, feeling dazed, sees an apparition of two boys (presumably the boys that bullied Marina in the orphanage). Laura yells at Marina, asking what she wants from her, the spirit of younger Marina appears and says that she wanted to be best friends with her as she leads Laura to Marina's rotten corpse and her laptop which transports Laura into one of Marina's earlier posts. Laura is then lunged at by a demonic Marina.
Some time has passed and there are fresh batch of students. Laura is seen looking at some girls in the same way that Marina looked at Laura and her friends in the beginning.

Thirty years later, the child has become the vampire hunter Blade. He raids a rave club owned by the vampire Deacon Frost. Police take one of the vampires to the hospital, where he feeds on hematologist Karen Jenson and escapes. Blade takes Karen to a safe house where she is treated by his old friend Abraham Whistler. Whistler explains that he and Blade have been waging a secret war against vampires using weapons based on their elemental weaknesses, such as sunlight and silver. As Karen is now ""marked"" by the bite of a vampire, both he and Blade tell her to leave the city.
Meanwhile, at a meeting of vampire elders, Frost, the leader of a faction of younger vampires, is rebuked for trying to incite war between vampires and humans. As Frost and his kind were not born as vampires and are therefore not pure-bloods, they are considered socially inferior. In response, Frost has one of the elders executed and strips the others of their authority.
Upon returning to her apartment, Karen is attacked by a policeman, who is a ""familiar"", a human slave controlled by a vampire. Blade subdues the familiar and uses information from him to locate an archive of vampire history. Later, at the hideout, Blade injects himself with a special serum that prevents him from succumbing to his desire to drink blood, which would ultimately turn him into a vampire. However, the serum is beginning to lose its effectiveness due to overuse.
While experimenting with the anticoagulant EDTA as a possible replacement, Karen discovers that it explodes when combined with vampire blood. She manages to synthesize a vaccine that can cure the infected, but learns that it will not work on a human-vampire hybrid like Blade. Frost and his men attack the hideout, infect Whistler, and abduct Karen. When Blade returns, he helps Whistler commit suicide and arms himself with special syringes filled with EDTA.
When Blade attempts to rescue Karen from Frost's penthouse, he is shocked to find his still alive mother, who reveals that she came back that very night and was brought in by Frost, who appears and reveals himself as the vampire who bit her. Blade is then subdued and taken to the Temple of Eternal Night, where Frost plans to perform the summoning ritual for La Magra, the vampire blood god. Blade is drained of his blood, but Karen allows him to drink from her, triggering his vampirism. Frost completes the ritual and obtains the powers of La Magra. Blade confronts Frost after killing all of his minions, including Blade's mother. During their fight, Blade injects Frost with all of the syringes, causing his body to inflate and explode, killing him.
Karen offers to help Blade cure himself, but he asks her to create a new serum instead.

A Passage to India,drama,"Adela Quested (Judy Davis) is sailing from England to British Raj India with Mrs Moore (Peggy Ashcroft), the latter the mother of her intended bridegroom, Ronny Heaslop (Nigel Havers); Mrs Moore's son from her first marriage. He is the Collector and the City magistrate in Chandrapore, the anglicized spelling of Chandrapur. Adela intends to see if she can make a go of it.
The ladies are disappointed to find that the British community is very much separated from the Indian population and culture with a growing Indian independence movement in the 1920s. They are encouraged when the local school superintendent Richard Fielding (James Fox), brings into their acquaintance the eccentric elderly Hindu Brahmin scholar Professor Narayan Godbole (Alec Guinness). Mrs Moore meets by chance another Indian local, Dr Aziz Ahmed (Victor Banerjee), a widower who is surprised by her kindness and lack of prejudice. Aziz offers to host an excursion to the local Marabar Caves.
The initial exploration of the caves shows that those included in the party should be limited when Mrs Moore suffers from claustrophobia and the noise from the large entourage echoes exponentially inside the caves. Mrs Moore encourages Adela and Aziz to continue their exploration of the caves alone with just one guide.
They reach the caves at a higher elevation some distance from the group and, before entering, Aziz steps away to take a cigarette. He returns to find Adela has disappeared. Shortly after he sees her running headlong down the hill, disheveled. She is picked up by the doctor's wife, Mrs. Callendar (Ann Firbank), and taken to the Callendars' home. Adela is bleeding and delirious. Dr Callendar medicates Adela with a hypodermic syringe.
Upon his return to Chandrapore, Aziz, accused of attempting to rape Adela at the caves, is jailed to await trial, and the incident becomes a cause célèbre. Mrs Moore firmly believes Aziz to not have committed any offense and she leaves India for England. At sea, Mrs Moore takes ill and dies quickly.
In court, Adela is questioned by the prosecution; it becomes clear to her that her earlier signed accusation of attempted rape was incorrect and she recants. Aziz is celebrated for his innocence and Adela is abandoned to her own devices by the British except for Mr Fielding who assists her to safety to the college. She plans to return to England at the earliest moment. Aziz rids himself of his western associations and vows to find a new job in an Indian state; he opens a clinic in the lake area near Srinagar, Kashmir.
Meanwhile, through Adela, Fielding has married Stella Moore, Mrs Moore's daughter from her second marriage. Aziz eventually reconciles with Fielding, and Aziz writes to Adela asking her to forgive him for taking so long to come to appreciate the courage she exercised when she withdrew her accusation in court.",drama adela quest judy davis sail england british raj india mrs moore peggy ashcroft mother intended bridegroom ronny heaslop nigel havers mrs moore son marriage collector city magistrate chandrapore anglicized spelling chandrapur adela intend lady disappoint find british community separate indian population culture grow indian independence movement encourage local school superintendent richard fielding james fox bring acquaintance eccentric elderly hindu brahmin scholar professor narayan godbole alec guinness mrs moore meet chance indian local dr aziz ahmed victor banerjee widower surprise kindness lack prejudice aziz offer host excursion local marabar cave initial exploration cave show include party limit mrs moore suffer claustrophobia noise large entourage echo exponentially inside cave mrs moore encourage adela aziz continue exploration cave guide reach cave high elevation distance group enter aziz step away cigarette return find adela disappear shortly see run headlong hill dishevel pick doctor wife mrs callendar ann firbank take callendar home adela bleed delirious dr callendar medicate adela hypodermic syringe return chandrapore aziz accuse attempt rape adela cave jail await trial incident cause célèbre mrs moore firmly believe aziz commit offense leave india england sea mrs moore take ill die quickly court adela question prosecution clear early sign accusation attempt rape incorrect recant aziz celebrate innocence adela abandon device british mr fielding assist safety college plan return england early moment aziz rid western association vow find new job indian state open clinic lake area near srinagar kashmir adela fielding marry stella moore mrs moore daughter second marriage aziz eventually reconcile fielding aziz write adela ask forgive take long come appreciate courage exercise withdraw accusation court
The Nightcomers,horror,"Recently orphaned, Flora and Miles are abandoned by their new guardian (Harry Andrews) and entrusted to the care of housekeeper Mrs. Grose (Thora Hird), governess Miss Jessel (Stephanie Beacham), and Peter Quint (Brando), the former valet and now gardener. With only these three adults for company, the children live an isolated life in the sprawling country manor estate. The children are particularly fascinated by Peter Quint due to his eclectic knowledge and engaging stories, and willingness to entertain them. With this captive audience, Quint doses out his strange philosophies on love and death. The governess, Miss Jessel, also falls under Peter's spell, and despite her repulsion the two embark on a sadomasochistic love affair. Flora and Miles become fascinated with this relationship, and help Quint and Jessel to escape the interference of disapproving Mrs. Grose.
The children begin spying on Quint and Jessel's violent trysts and mimick what they see, including the bondage, culminating in Miles nearly pushing Flora off a building to her death. Mrs. Grose determines to write to the absent master of the house in order to get both Quint and Jessel sacked. The children are most distressed by this, and decide to take matters into their own hands to prevent the separation. Acting on Quint's assertions that love is hate and it is only in death that people can truly be united, the children murder Miss Jessel by knocking a hole in the boat she uses to wait for Quint (who never keeps the appointments), knowing that she cannot swim. Quint later finds Miss Jessel's rigid body in the water, but is given little time to mourn before Miles kills him with a bow and arrow. The film ends with the arrival of a new governess, presumably the one who features in The Turn of the Screw.",horror recently orphan flora mile abandon new guardian harry andrews entrust care housekeeper mrs grose thora hird governess miss jessel stephanie beacham peter quint brando valet gardener adult company child live isolated life sprawl country manor estate child particularly fascinate peter quint eclectic knowledge engaging story willingness entertain captive audience quint dose strange philosophy love death governess miss jessel fall peter spell despite repulsion embark sadomasochistic love affair flora mile fascinated relationship help quint jessel escape interference disapprove mrs grose child begin spy quint jessel violent tryst mimick include bondage culminate mile nearly push flora building death mrs grose determine write absent master house order quint jessel sack child distressed decide matter hand prevent separation act quint assertion love hate death people truly unite child murder miss jessel knock hole boat use wait quint keep appointment know swim quint later find miss jessel rigid body water give little time mourn mile kill bow arrow film end arrival new governess presumably feature turn screw

Désirée,historical,"In 1794, in Marseille, Désirée Clary makes the acquaintance of a Corsican, Joseph Bonaparte, and invites him and his brother, General Napoleon Bonaparte, to call upon the family the following day. The next day, Julie, Désirée's sister, and Joseph are immediately attracted to each other, and Napoleon is taken with Désirée. He admits to her that the poor Bonaparte brothers need the rich dowries of the Clary sisters. Later, Désirée learns that Napoleon has been arrested and taken to Paris.
Napoleon eventually returns to Marseille, tells Désirée that he has been cleared of all charges, but has been ordered to track down royalists in Paris. Désirée begs Napoleon to leave the Army and join her brother in business, but he scoffs at the idea and instead proposes marriage. Désirée accepts and lends Napoleon the money to return to Paris.
Napoleon tells her that he will always love her and will return soon for their wedding, but, as the months pass, Désirée starts doubting him and goes to the city where she meets General Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. She learns that Napoleon is engaged to the wealthy Joséphine de Beauharnais. Désirée contemplates suicide, but Bernadotte, who has fallen in love with her, stops her.
Later, in 1797, Napoleon, now France’s leading general, has succeeded in conquering Italy, and Désirée lives in Rome with Julie and Joseph. She soon tires of Rome, however, and decides to return to Paris, where she meets Napoleon, now married to Josephine, who announces that he will be leaving for Egypt. Bernadotte is thrilled to see Désirée again and proposes marriage to her.
By July 4, 1799, Désirée and Bernadotte have happily settled into married life and have a son, Oscar (Nicholas Koster). On November 9, 1799, Napoleon is proclaimed First Consul of the French Republic and asks Bernadotte to join his council of state, and Bernadotte agrees.
Several years later, Napoleon is proclaimed emperor, and at his coronation, he takes the crown from the hands of Pope Pius VII and crowns himself.
Five years later, desperate for an heir, Napoleon divorces Josephine, and Désirée comforts her former rival, before Napoleon’s upcoming marriage to the 18-year-old Marie Louise of Austria. Napoleon involves France in more wars, and Bernadotte is approached by representatives of the king of Sweden, who wishes to adopt him and make him the heir to the throne. Désirée, stunned by the news that she will one day be a queen, nevertheless supports her husband, and eventually Napoleon allows both of them to leave Paris.
In Stockholm, Désirée does not fit in with the royal family and asks to go home. Eight months later, she attends a ball in Paris at which Napoleon shows off his new son. Napoleon makes veiled threats about Bernadotte’s alliance with Russia and announces to the crowd that she will be held hostage to ensure Sweden’s support while his army marches through Russia to Moscow.
Napoleon’s army is defeated, and he visits Désirée, asking her to write a letter to Bernadotte, requesting his help. Désirée realizes that Napoleon still loves her and came more for her than to seek her husband’s help. Soon after, Bernadotte leads one of the armies that overwhelms Napoleon, and the triumphant general reunites with Désirée before returning to Sweden.
Napoleon’s exile to Elba is short-lived, however, and after the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon retreats with his personal army to the Château de Malmaison. Representatives of the allied armies ask Désirée to speak with Napoleon, hoping that she can persuade him to surrender. Napoleon agrees to speak with Désirée alone, and muses on what his destiny would have been if he had married her. Napoleon proclaims that he has given his life to protect France, but Désirée gently tells him that he must do as France asks and go into exile on St. Helena. Commenting on how strange it is that the two most outstanding men of their time had fallen in love with her, Napoleon gives Désirée his sword in surrender and assures her that her dowry was not the only reason that he proposed to her many years ago in Marseille.",historical marseille désirée clary make acquaintance corsican joseph bonaparte invite brother general napoleon bonaparte family follow day day julie désirée sister joseph immediately attract napoleon take désirée admit poor bonaparte brother need rich dowry clary sister later désirée learn napoleon arrest take paris napoleon eventually return marseille tell désirée clear charge order track royalist paris désirée beg napoleon leave army join brother business scoff idea instead propose marriage désirée accept lend napoleon money return paris napoleon tell love return soon wedding month pass désirée start doubt go city meet general jean baptiste bernadotte learn napoleon engage wealthy joséphine de beauharnais désirée contemplate suicide bernadotte fall love stop later napoleon france lead general succeed conquer italy désirée life rome julie joseph soon tire rome decide return paris meet napoleon married josephine announce leave egypt bernadotte thrill désirée propose marriage july désirée bernadotte happily settle married life son oscar nicholas koster november napoleon proclaim consul french republic ask bernadotte join council state bernadotte agree year later napoleon proclaim emperor coronation take crown hand pope pius vii crown year later desperate heir napoleon divorce josephine désirée comfort rival napoleon upcoming marriage year old marie louise austria napoleon involve france war bernadotte approach representative king sweden wish adopt heir throne désirée stun news day queen support husband eventually napoleon allow leave paris stockholm désirée fit royal family ask home month later attend ball paris napoleon show new son napoleon make veiled threat bernadotte alliance russia announce crowd hold hostage ensure sweden support army march russia moscow napoleon army defeat visit désirée ask write letter bernadotte request help désirée realize napoleon love come seek husband help soon bernadotte lead army overwhelm napoleon triumphant general reunite désirée return sweden napoleon exile elba short live battle waterloo napoleon retreat personal army château de malmaison representative ally army ask désirée speak napoleon hope persuade surrender napoleon agree speak désirée muse destiny marry napoleon proclaim give life protect france désirée gently tell france ask exile st helena comment strange outstanding man time fall love napoleon give désirée sword surrender assure dowry reason propose year ago marseille

Con Air,action,"Honorably discharged Army Ranger Cameron Poe is convicted of manslaughter after killing a drunken man who tried to attack his pregnant wife Tricia and imprisoned for ten years, communicating with his newborn daughter Casey through letters. Eight years later, he is paroled and takes a flight to Alabama on board the Jailbird, a Fairchild C-123 Provider converted into a flying prison transport. He is accompanied by his diabetic cellmate and friend Mike “Baby-O” O’Dell, who is being transferred. The flight is overseen by U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin, who is approached by DEA agents Duncan Malloy and Willie Sims, the latter planning to go undercover to get information from drug baron Francisco Cindino, who is to be picked up on route.
A number of inmates are being transferred to a new supermax prison, including mass murderer William ""Billy Bedlam"" Bedford, rapist John “Johnny 23” Baca, Black Guerrilla Family member Nathan “Diamond Dog” Jones, and criminal mastermind “Cyrus the Virus” Grissom. After taking off, inmate Joe “Pinball” Parker incites a riot, releasing Grissom and Diamond Dog, taking over the plane, planning to land at Carson Airport as scheduled, pick up and transfer other prisoners, and then fly to a non-extradition country. Sims tries to take control of the plane, but Grissom kills him. Poe and Grissom also foil Johnny 23's rape attempts on the plane's only female guard, Sally Bishop.
The plane arrives at Carson City as scheduled, and the inmate exchange commences, with the ground crew unaware that the hijacking inmates are disguised as guards. As the transfer begins, most of the plane’s guards and the pilot are forced to pose as inmates and conveyed off the plane. Amongst the new passengers are Cindino, new pilot Earl “Swamp Thing” Williams, and serial killer Garland Greene. The authorities discover the hijacking upon finding evidence in Grissom’s old cell and a tape recorder placed with the disguised guards by Poe, but are unable to stop the plane from taking off. Meanwhile, Pinball, sent by the inmates to dispose of the plane's transponder to keep it from being detected, tries but fails to make it back to the hijacked plane.
The inmates plan to land at Lerner Airport, an abandoned airstrip in the desert, and transfer onto another plane owned by Cindino and his cartel. Poe finds Pinball’s corpse trapped in the landing gear, writing a message to the US Marshals on the body before throwing it out. Larkin learns of the news and heads out to Lerner after contacting the National Guard. Bedford, raiding the cargo, discovers Poe’s identity when he reads his daughter's letter and finds a toy bunny, forcing Poe to kill him.
The Jailbird is grounded at Lerner, with no sign of the transfer aircraft. Poe warns the other inmates of Cindino's past acts of deceit and betrayal, and thus Grisson orders the others to fuel up the Jailbird and get it ready for takeoff. Poe leaves to find Baby-O some insulin shots, meeting Larkin and informing him of the situation. The duo discover Cindino planning to escape on a hidden private jet, with Larkin sabotaging it as it takes off. Grissom executes Cindino by igniting the crashed plane’s fuel.
Meanwhile, Johnny 23, assigned as the sentry in the control tower, spots a National Guard convoy approaching and gives the alarm. The inmates quickly find a cache of fully loaded shotguns and assault rifles in the plane's cargo hold (originally assigned to correction officers) and prepare an ambush. As the National Guard troops arrive, the inmates launch an assault on them and kill some, but Larkin defends the surviving troops using a bulldozer as a makeshift shield. Several inmates are killed, and the rest flee back onto the Jailbird and take flight.
Poe’s identity is revealed when Bedford’s body is found. Grissom is about to execute him and Baby-O when Larkin and Malloy arrive in attack helicopters, launching machine gun fire at it and damaging the Jailbird’s fuel tank. Though Larkin orders the plane to land at McCarran International Airport, Swamp Thing is forced to land it on the Las Vegas Strip, causing mass destruction and killing Johnny 23. Cyrus, Diamond Dog, and Swamp Thing escape on a fire truck, pursued by Poe and Larkin on police motorcycles, leading to the deaths of all three convicts. Most of the other convicts are quickly taken back into custody. Poe and Larkin form a friendship, just as Tricia and Casey arrive. Poe meets his daughter for the first time and gives her the toy rabbit he bought for her.

The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer,comedy,"Margaret Turner (Myrna Loy) and Susan Turner (Shirley Temple) are sisters who live together. Susan is an intelligent 17-year-old high-school student with a habit of forming short-lived interests after hearing the regular guest lectures at the school. Margaret is a judge, and Susan's guardian.
Richard Nugent (Cary Grant), a handsome and sophisticated artist, is a defendant in Margaret's courtroom, charged by ADA Tommy Chamberlain (Rudy Vallee) with starting a nightclub brawl. She releases him with a warning when it becomes clear that the fight was started by two women fighting over him.
He proceeds to Susan's school, where he is the guest lecturer for the day—and as he speaks, Susan becomes infatuated with him. After the talk she finds a reason to spend time with him and suggests she model for him; that evening, she puts on a sophisticated dress and sneaks away from home and into his apartment while he is out.
Richard has no sooner discovered Susan in his apartment than Tommy and Margaret arrive to rescue her from his presumed seduction. Richard assaults Tommy and is held in jail until Matt Beemish (Ray Collins), who is the court psychiatrist and also Margaret and Susan's uncle, intervenes and explains the true situation. He recommends allowing Susan to date Richard until the infatuation burns itself out; Tommy will drop the assault charge if Richard complies.
At a high-school basketball game, Richard tries unsuccessfully to boost Susan's image of Jerry White (Johnny Sands), the boyfriend she dumped for him. Later, at a school picnic, Susan persuades Richard to enter a series of novelty races (open to adult family members), where he loses repeatedly to Tommy. But in the main event, an obstacle course, she asks Jerry to help Richard win. Because he still loves her, Jerry complies, helping him directly at one point, then colliding with Tommy so that Richard does win the event.
Meanwhile, Richard and Margaret are becoming attracted to each other, to the discomfiture of Tommy, who sees Richard as a habitual troublemaker and wants Margaret for himself. Hoping Richard will stop seeing Margaret if he no longer has to date Susan, Tommy announces he is dropping the charge. But Richard and Margaret go out to a nightclub, where they are interrupted in succession by all the other main characters as well as a former girlfriend of Richard's. They all part angrily.
Afterwards, though, Matt is able to talk sense into Susan, and she returns to Jerry. Matt finds out that Richard has decided to take a trip and is able to manipulate affairs so that Margaret will travel with him. Learning that Tommy is coming to arrest Richard on trumped-up charges, Matt forestalls him by telling police at the airport that Tommy is a mental patient with delusions of being an ADA.

Gentleman Jim,bio-pic,"In 1890s San Francisco, boxing is illegal. James J. Corbett (Errol Flynn), a brash young bank teller, attends a match with his friend Walter Lowrie (Jack Carson). When a police raid nets Judge Geary, a member of the board of directors of Corbett's bank, Corbett's fast talking gets his superior out of trouble. The judge is looking to improve the image of boxing by recruiting men from more respectable backgrounds and having them fight under the Marquess of Queensberry rules. He has even imported British coach Harry Watson (Rhys Williams) to evaluate prospects. Watson finds that Corbett, raised in a combative Irish immigrant family headed by Pat Corbett (Alan Hale), has excellent fighting skills; Geary likes his protégé's seemingly-polished manner.
However, Corbett's arrogance irritates many of the upper class, particularly Victoria Ware (Alexis Smith). They clash frequently, but Corbett is attracted to her, and his limitless self-confidence and charm eventually overcome her distaste for him.
Meanwhile, Corbett becomes a professional prizefighter. He acquires a manager, Billy Delaney (William Frawley), and introduces a new, more sophisticated style of boxing, emphasizing footwork over the unscientific brawling epitomized by world champion John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). After winning several matches, Corbett finally gets the opportunity to take on the great man. Corbett's method of boxing baffles Sullivan, and Corbett wins not only the title, but also Victoria.

Around the World in 80 Days,adventure,"In 1890, England, a Chinese man, Lau Xing, robs the Bank of England. To evade the police, Xing becomes the valet for Phileas Fogg, an inventor, taking the pseudonym Passepartout. Phileas, just before Xing arrived, had been trying to break the 50-mph speed barrier, and after succeeding with the help of Passepartout, they head to the Royal Academy of Science. There, Fogg is insulted by the other ""brilliant minds"", in particular Lord Kelvin, who believes that everything worth discovering has already been discovered. After a debate between the scientists about the bank thief, Phileas is pressured into a bet to see whether he can travel around the world in 80 days. If he wins, he will become Minister of Science in Lord Kelvin's place, if not, he will destroy his lab and never invent anything again. Phileas and Xing start their journey around the world, taking a carriage and leaving London after a confrontation with Inspector Fix, a corrupt officer hired by Lord Kelvin to stop them.
Xing and Phileas journey to Paris, France. Pretending to take Phileas to a convention with Thomas Edison, Xing leads him to an art school where Phileas meets Monique La Roche, a would-be impressionist. There, Xing is attacked by disguised warriors, the Black Scorpions, sent by General Fang, a warlord from China who is after the Jade Buddha that he stole. Fang had previously given it to Kelvin in exchange for military assistance in China. When Monique learns of Phileas's ambition, she convinces them to take her with them. They depart in a hot-air balloon, chased by Fang's warriors.
Whilst on the Orient Express, Monique learns that Xing is trying to return the Jade Buddha back to his village, and is travelling with Phileas to get there quickly. Monique keeps his secret in exchange for him convincing Phileas to let her travel with him. They travel to Turkey, where the train stops. Guards climb onboard and inform the trio that they are greeted by Prince Hapi. During the Prince's banquet, he orders Monique to stay as his seventh wife while the men are ordered to leave. The men blackmail Prince Hapi into releasing Monique using a prized but apparently flimsy ""The Thinker"" statue of the Prince. The statue is destroyed, much to Hapi's anger, but the trio escape from the guards. Lord Kelvin, learning that Phileas has been abetting a thief's escape, orders the British colonial authorities in India to arrest both. Xing notices this and warns his companions, disguising themselves as Indian women to evade capture and successfully flee to China. On the train Xing tells the story of the Ten Tigers of Canton to children. Fogg tells him legends are meaningless and Xing tells him that him traveling around the world in eighty days is a legend.
Xing leads his friends to his village, Lanzhou, where they are happily greeted. Phileas, however, finds out Xing stole the Jade Buddha and leaves, but is immediately captured along with Xing and Monique by the Black Scorpions. With them is a man who was imprisoned for public urination. Xing challenges the leader of the group to a fight, during which he is joined by the martial arts masters of the ""Ten Tigers of Canton"", of which Xing is a member. The Tigers drive the Black Scorpions from the village and free the Westerners. The Buddha is returned to the village temple. Phileas, feeling used by Xing and Monique, leaves for San Francisco, United States, alone, only to be proven wrong when the latter decide to help him win his bet. In New York City, Fang's disguised minions trick the trio to an ambush site. Fang reveals the nature of their arrangements with Lord Kelvin to take Lanzhou and tap the jade reserves underneath it. A battle against Fang and her minions commences in the workshop where the Statue of Liberty is being constructed, resulting in Phileas missing a boat to help Xing. Fang's minions were defeated and Xing nearly dies to save Phileas. Fang also survived but was knocked out by Monique with a punch and Xing joked that she was the 11th Tiger. Phileas feels he has lost, but the other two say they may still make it if they catch the next ship.
They board an old ship and Phileas convinces the captain to let him build a plane out of the ship's old wood in exchange for a new ship. Using an altered version of the Wright brothers' plans, Phileas builds the plane while the ship's crew builds a catapult to launch it into the sky. They reach London, where the machine falls apart and they crash in front of the Royal Academy. Lord Kelvin sends police to arrest them for robbing the bank, in order to stop them from making it to the top step of the Academy, and proclaims himself the victor when Big Ben strikes noon, seemingly ending the wager. Monique, Fix and other ministers attest to Kelvin's unfair methods and his bullying nature, but Kelvin scoffs at them. In the process he insults Queen Victoria, who arrives on the scene. She learned that he had sold her arsenal to Fang in exchange for jade mines in China thanks to one of his aides. Kelvin is arrested and sent to prison, and Phileas realizes he is one day early thanks to crossing the international date line. He victoriously ascends the stairs of the Academy and kisses Monique.",adventure england chinese man lau xing rob bank england evade police xing valet philea fogg inventor take pseudonym passepartout philea xing arrive try break mph speed barrier succeed help passepartout head royal academy science fogg insult brilliant mind particular lord kelvin believe worth discover discover debate scientist bank thief philea pressure bet travel world day win minister science lord kelvin place destroy lab invent philea xing start journey world take carriage leave london confrontation inspector fix corrupt officer hire lord kelvin stop xing philea journey paris france pretend philea convention thomas edison xing lead art school philea meet monique la roche impressionist xing attack disguised warrior black scorpion send general fang warlord china jade buddha steal fang previously give kelvin exchange military assistance china monique learn philea ambition convince depart hot air balloon chase fang warrior whilst orient express monique learn xing try return jade buddha village travel philea quickly monique keep secret exchange convince philea let travel travel turkey train stop guard climb onboard inform trio greet prince hapi prince banquet order monique stay seventh wife man order leave man blackmail prince hapi release monique prized apparently flimsy thinker statue prince statue destroy hapi anger trio escape guard lord kelvin learn philea abet thief escape order british colonial authority india arrest xing notice warn companion disguise indian woman evade capture successfully flee china train xing tell story tiger canton child fogg tell legend meaningless xing tell travel world eighty day legend xing lead friend village lanzhou happily greet philea find xing steal jade buddha leave immediately capture xing monique black scorpion man imprison public urination xing challenge leader group fight join martial art master tiger canton xing member tiger drive black scorpion village free westerner buddha return village temple philea feel xing monique leave san francisco united states prove wrong decide help win bet new york city fang disguised minion trick trio ambush site fang reveal nature arrangement lord kelvin lanzhou tap jade reserve underneath battle fang minion commence workshop statue liberty construct result philea miss boat help xing fang minion defeat xing nearly die save philea fang survive knock monique punch xing joke tiger philea feel lose catch ship board old ship philea convince captain let build plane ship old wood exchange new ship altered version wright brother plan philea build plane ship crew build catapult launch sky reach london machine fall apart crash royal academy lord kelvin send police arrest rob bank order stop make step academy proclaim victor big ben strike noon seemingly end wager monique fix minister attest kelvin unfair method bullying nature kelvin scoff process insult queen victoria arrive scene learn sell arsenal fang exchange jade mine china thank aide kelvin arrest send prison philea realize day early thank cross international date line victoriously ascend stair academy kiss monique

Lost Honeymoon,comedy,"Soon after the end of World War II a young English woman, Amy Atkins (Ann Richards), goes back to the London flat where she and her best friend, Tillie Grey, once used to live. The housekeeper Mrs. Tubbs (Una O'Connor) meets Amy and reveals to her that Tillie went ill right before she was off to America to look for the man she married during the war. Tillie died from her illness before she could make her journey, and left two orphaned twin children, Joyce and Johnny Jr. To honor her old friend and make her husband honour his obligations Amy decides to make the journey that Tillie had planned and complete task of finding her husband, Johnny. Amy modifies Tillie's new passport and travels to America by boat on the ticket Tillie had bought, posing as her best friend.
The only information Amy has about her best friend's husband is that his name is John ""Johnny"" Grey, and that he is supposed to reside in Rochester, NY. To get more information of the whereabouts of Johnny, she asks aid from the American Red Cross. Just when Amy is about to land at the docks in New York City, a man named John Grey - a New York architect living in Rochester - gets a telegram informing him of the arrival of his wife and children by boat. This John Grey (Franchot Tone is shocked, since he is about to marry the socialité daughter, Lois (Frances Rafferty, of his boss Mr. Evans (Clarence Kolb) of his architectural firm that same weekend. Thinking it may by chance be a man with the same name Johnny contacts all the ""John Grey""s of Rochester to find out that none were married in England.
It is true that he spent some time in England during the war, and he may have met some woman, but he lacks every memory of Tillie and her two twin children because he was suffering from amnesia. He confesses to his friend Dr. Bob Davis (Tom Conway) that he may have married a woman in London. Just prior to his airborne division being sent to fight in Continental Europe he was on leave in London during a bombing raid where he hit his head on a lamp post. He lost his memory for a total of six weeks and was recorded as missing in action. Eventually the US Military found him and he was cured of his amnesia and brought home across the Atlantic. What exactly happened during those six weeks is a blur, but everyone in America who knew John thought he was wounded in battle.
Johnny has a big bachelor party planned for the same night, and cannot meet Amy by the boat at her arrival. Amy starts a pointless search for a ""John Grey from Rochester"" and finds nothing. She decides to go to Rochester and continue her search. By accident she happens to check in at the same hotel as the one where the bachelor party takes place, and Johnny resides. By mistake, and because Amy is looking for John Grey, she and the twins are taken for a hired act to perform at the bachelor party dinner. Johnny's friends jokingly present Amy, Joyce and Johnny Jr. in front of everyone at the party as his ""wife and kids"", and Johnny is humiliated.
Amy is still posing as Johnny's wife Tillie, when she confronts Johnny right there at the party on his responsibilities as a husband and father. Johnny has no chance of recognizing Amy, since they never met, and he denies being married to her; still believing that she in fact is Tillie - his English wife. Panicked by the incident Johnny has quite a few drinks with his best friend Bob who tries to get Johnny to relive his stormy crossing to the United Kingdom and his commando training in an effort to get him to recall what occurred during his amnesia but they are unsuccessful. They wander the streets, afraid of going back to face Amy/Tillie, who has camped in the hotel lobby, waiting for him to show his face. Because of his intoxication Johnny gets into a quarrel with a police officer in the street. Due to the lack of other options he eventually decides to lose his memory and get ""amnesia"" again. He deliberately runs into another lamppost and knocks himself out.
Later in the night Amy is informed that her ""husband"" is down at the Rochester police station waiting for her. She goes over there to pick him up, but he is going on and on about his amnesia. A nearby news reporter overhears their conversation and finds out that Amy is a ""war bride"", which, considering that Johnny is about to marry a socialité that weekend, is big news. The next morning it is all over the news that John is already married to an English woman. Subsequently, the engagement to his bosses daughter is broken off and he immediately loses his job at the architectural firm. Johnny decides to do his duty and devote himself to take care of his children; he finds himself pretty well in the role as a father and is beginning to enjoy himself. Meeting Amy/Tillie on a regular basis he gets more and more attracted to her - his ""wife"". Amy pretends to remember with fondness their six-week romance all those years ago, but problems arise when Johnny wants to get closer and demand his conjugal rights. Amy tries to get away by saying that he should fall in love again, since it was such a long time ago they met.
Johnny is frustrated by this and seeks his best friend Bob's advice on the matter. Bob has also grown fond of Amy/Tillie and is attracted to her in the same way Johnny is. Bob's deceitful advice is for Johnny to back off, since Amy/Tillie may not be attracted to this ""new"" Johnny at all. Another problem is arising when Amy learns that the Red Cross has found out about her fake identity and threatens have her deported as an illegal immigrant using false documents. The Red Cross also claim that Johnny cannot be burdened with the responsibility of the twins, since there is no hard eveidence that he really is their father. Amy feels forced to tell Johnny and Bob the truth about her deceit. The same day as she gets the notice from the Red Cross, she also gets two photographs from the housekeeper Mrs. Tubbs in England, showing Tillie and Johnny, in love, back during the war, when he had his amnesia. There is also a photo showing Tillie with the twins.
The photograph is proof enough that Johnny is the twins' father and secures their future with him in America. Amy, however, still risks being deported as an illegal alien with fraudulent documents, since the photographs prove that she in fact isn't who she has claimed to be. When word of her deceit spreads, Johnny's engagement to his bosses daughter Lois is again feasible. Johnny's job is also back at hand. Johnny agrees to marry Lois the next day.
During the night, however, John does a lot of thinking and concludes that he is in love with Amy, not Tillie, and he doesn't want Bob to pursue her. He decides to pretend having another amnesia episode and get Lois to call off the wedding because he doesn't remember that he loves her. After meeting with Lois he rushes off to meet with Amy. In his hurry he loses control of the car and crashes it right into the hotel where Amy stays. Johnny is injured and ends up in a hospital. Amy visits him and he proposes to her from his sick-bed. Lois arrives and faints when she sees Johnny with Amy and the twins.[3]",comedy soon end world war ii young english woman amy atkin ann richard go london flat good friend tillie grey live housekeeper mrs tubbs una meet amy reveal tillie go ill right america look man marry war tillie die illness journey leave orphan twin child joyce johnny jr honor old friend husband honour obligation amy decide journey tillie plan complete task find husband johnny amy modifies tillie new passport travel america boat ticket tillie buy pose good friend information amy good friend husband john johnny grey suppose reside rochester ny information whereabouts johnny ask aid american red cross amy land dock new york city man name john grey new york architect live rochester get telegram inform arrival wife child boat john grey franchot tone shock marry socialité daughter lois france rafferty boss mr evans clarence kolb architectural firm weekend think chance man johnny contact john rochester find marry england true spend time england war meet woman lack memory tillie twin child suffer amnesia confess friend dr bob davis tom conway marry woman london prior airborne division send fight continental europe leave london bombing raid hit head lamp post lose memory total week record miss action eventually military find cure amnesia bring home atlantic exactly happen week blur america know john think wound battle johnny big bachelor party plan night meet amy boat arrival amy start pointless search john grey rochester find decide rochester continue search accident happen check hotel bachelor party take place johnny resides mistake amy look john grey twin take hire act perform bachelor party dinner johnny friend jokingly present amy joyce johnny jr party wife kid johnny humiliate amy pose johnny wife tillie confront johnny right party responsibility husband father johnny chance recognize amy meet deny married believe fact tillie english wife panic incident johnny drink good friend bob try johnny relive stormy crossing united kingdom commando training effort recall occur amnesia unsuccessful wander street afraid go face amy tillie camp hotel lobby wait face intoxication johnny get quarrel police officer street lack option eventually decide lose memory amnesia deliberately run lamppost knock later night amy inform husband rochester police station wait go pick go amnesia nearby news reporter overhear conversation find amy war bride consider johnny marry socialité weekend big news morning news john married english woman subsequently engagement boss daughter break immediately lose job architectural firm johnny decide duty devote care child find pretty role father begin enjoy meet amy tillie regular basis get attracted wife amy pretend remember fondness week romance year ago problem arise johnny want close demand conjugal right amy try away say fall love long time ago meet johnny frustrate seek good friend bob advice matter bob grow fond amy tillie attract way johnny bob deceitful advice johnny amy tillie attract new johnny problem arise amy learn red cross find fake identity threatens deport illegal immigrant false document red cross claim johnny burden responsibility twin hard eveidence father amy feels force tell johnny bob truth deceit day get notice red cross get photograph housekeeper mrs tubbs england show tillie johnny love war amnesia photo show tillie twin photograph proof johnny twin father secure future america amy risk deport illegal alien fraudulent document photograph prove fact claim word deceit spread johnny engagement boss daughter lois feasible johnny job hand johnny agree marry lois day night john lot thinking conclude love amy tillie want bob pursue decide pretend have amnesia episode lois wedding remember love meet lois rush meet amy hurry lose control car crash right hotel amy stay johnny injure end hospital amy visit propose sick bed lois arrive faint see johnny amy

Her father, who brought her to Macau from mainland China, was an inveterate gambler who has since died, leaving her with a large pile of debts and a gambling habit of her own. Despite this, she is a good-natured girl who balances her money problems with a longing to find some meaning in her life and a boyfriend she has feelings for.
Daniel Luo (Wu Xiubo) is a real estate broker in Los Angeles who moved there with his parents from Beijing 20 years prior, although they subsequently divorced and both returned to China. Daniel has since built an outwardly successful life for himself in California, selling properties to wealthy Chinese buyers, but his parents' divorce when he was young still affects him, and he refuses to get into any kind of close emotional relationship.
Both Jiao and Daniel come across an old book, ""84 Charing Cross Road"", which tells the story of New York writer Helene Hanff and her 20-year correspondence with British bookseller Frank Doel, whose shop was at 84 Charing Cross Road in London. Daniel and Jiao, both in foul moods and blaming the book for recent misfortunes in their lives, decide to get rid of it by mailing the book to the address in the title. Unbeknown to either of them, the current proprietor of 84 Charing Cross Road, Mr Thomas, is an elderly gentleman who enjoys matchmaking and redirects the letters from Jiao and Daniel to each other.
Over the course of the next year, Daniel and Jiao begin a regular correspondence by sending letters to 84 Charing Cross Road, each believing the other to be a Chinese person living in London. Mr Thomas continues forwarding their letters without their knowledge. The letters are hostile at first, but eventually a genuine friendship develops. Jiao incurs a large debt and accompanies a rich client to Las Vegas to pay it off. Meanwhile, Daniel befriends an elderly Chinese couple who own a house he wants to buy, but since he knows they would never approve of his plan to tear their house down and replace it with two new ones, he tries an underhanded tactic to trick them into selling. As part of his plan, he also takes them to Las Vegas for a vacation, and nearly crosses paths with Jiao several times, although neither knows what the other looks like.
Daniel begins to feel guilty about what he is doing, and his plan is eventually found out by the old couple. Jiao's relationship with her client ends, and she and Daniel console each other through their letters. Around the same time, they also both decide to reveal their real identities to each other. However, Mr Thomas passes away before the letters admitting their identities can be forwarded on, and both Jiao and Daniel believe the other person has decided to break off the relationship. They also have no way of getting in touch with each other anymore.
Realizing their growing feelings for each other, and desperately seeking news of what has happened to the other person, Daniel and Jiao travel separately to 84 Charing Cross Road, where they learn the truth about who has been forwarding their letters, and are also told about Mr Thomas's upcoming funeral. At the service, they just miss finding each other, although Daniel realizes that Jiao was also in attendance when he sees a tribute card she leaves for Mr Thomas at the funeral. However, none of their attempts to locate the other person work. Having given up, both Daniel and Jiao return to 84 Charing Cross Road one last time to leave a farewell letter, where they finally meet.

Dilwale,romance,"The film opens at a mental asylum, where doctors discuss the strange case of Arun Saxena (Ajay Devgn). His behaviour is very different to all the other mental patients. Arun tries to escape from the hospital, but is stopped just in the nick of time by the doctors. Arun's mother (Reema Lagoo) sits in front of Mandir everyday with her back turned to God, only vowing to face God when hope comes. Enter Inspector Vikram Singh (Sunil Shetty), a tough no-nonsense hot-headed young honest cop who has been assigned the case of Arun. At first, Vikram refuses thinking he will go mental, but during a visit to Arun, he is touched by seeing his behaviour towards his former flame Sapna, because of whom he became mental.
Vikram demands answers as to how a person like Arun could commit a murder. so he visits Arun's mum where the story goes into a flashback: Arun was a happy free-spirited young man who was always jovial in his life. Whilst attending his college's friend birthday party, Arun is love struck when he sees Sapna (Raveena Tandon) and immediately falls in love with her, despite her not knowing this. Sapna's evil uncle Mama Thakur (Paresh Rawal) has been holding a facade for the last 20 years as his hidden motive is to usurp Sapna's wealth. Arun makes it clear to everyone in the college how much he loves Sapna and will go to any lengths for her when he bashes up Shankar Bihari (Gulshan Grover) a goon hired by Mama Thakur to marry Sapna, so that he can get her wealth. Sapna at first, thinks Arun is a flirt, but later confesses her love for Arun after seeing Arun almost commit suicide for her.
Jyoti (Navneet Nishan) grows jealous at this and wants Arun at any cost. When Sapna sees this, she mistakes this as an affair. Arun reaches Sapna's mansion and clears the confusion, however Mama sees this and tries to attack Arun. Arun stands up to Mama Thakur's fear tactics and installs that fear in Mama. Mama, feeling insulted due to his false pride and ego, sends goons to kill Arun. Arun is tied up and taken home, where he and his mother are assaulted, which sparks Arun into action and he single-handedly beats all of Mama Thakur's goons. Despite receiving death threats, Arun continues to pursue Sapna. Joyti is falsely invited by Mama Thakur to click nude pictures at Arun's house and is murdered. Arun is framed for the murder due to his acquaintance with her. Arun's mum is brutally tortured by Mama Thakur when she comes to visit him in jail. Arun is thus forced to accept the murder in the court. When he pleads falsely guilty, Sapna starts hating him and Arun is unable to take this shock which drives him insane. One final attempt to kill Mama Thakur fails in the court and he is then taken to a mental asylum.
Back to the present day, Vikram promises Arun's mum that he will fight for Arun's justice. Vikram slowly becomes a thorn to Mama Thakur's illegal activities. Mama Thakur is in more trouble, because Natwar had secretly clicked pictures of the murder and keeps blackmailing Mama, therefore Natwar is killed by hired contract killers. Arun, whilst running away from a mental hospital van witnesses this. He reaches back to the mental hospital and draws evidence of the murderer in his hospital room wall. Vikram now realizes he has to catch Mama Thakur and starts to gather evidence against him. He also has to protect Arun by giving him accommodation at his home as his life is in danger. Mama Thakur tries to humiliate Vikram after he refuses to accept a bribe, but he and his brother are given a taste of their own medicine when they become smartasses to Vikram. Later, Vikram gets to know that the girl that he loved was actually Sapna, but she is Arun's now. Vikram has to reunite Arun with his love. He painfully makes Ram Singh tell the truth to Sapna as he was present when Arun's mum and him were tortured, but he was helpless due to Mama Thakur's fear and Sapna is very resentful due to the mistake she gravely made.
Arun becomes better under Vikram's care. He almost gets killed by the men who killed Natwar after Vikram visited the mansion and told Mama Thakur his days were over. Arun gets an electric shock, however, that shock brings back all his memories and makes him sane again. Arun is now discharged from the hospital. Arun is sentenced to be hanged as soon as he is better, but escapes to reunite with Sapna with Vikram's help. Arun then goes on a brutal vengeance mission and burns almost every godown (warehouse) of Mama Thakur, which angers the commissioner as he cannot persuade Arun to surrender. Arun then captures Mama Thakur from a police protection van and bashes him up badly. Vikram and Sapna arrive at the scene after Vikram rescues her from Shankar Bihari. All the goons are then killed. Arun's revenge is complete with Mama Thakur dead and Sapna back with him again.

A Brand New You,comedy,"In this quirky dark comedy Santiago Morales (Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz) a former engineer, is unable to come to terms with the passing of his wife Viviana (Dalal Badr) who has died of cancer. Santiago rents a room in a house as he struggles to get his financial affairs from the marriage sorted out. He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room. Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray (Clinton Lee Pontes) who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear in the living room of the house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired. He is itching to get back in the saddle so together they devise a plan involving the other housemate, Laura (Freya Ravensbergen), to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life. Laura has just lost her waitressing job and is unable to pay her debts so when presented with a relative financial windfall for her role, she reluctantly agrees to take part in the scheme to be the surrogate for their bizarro cloning experiment.
The film is unique and offbeat as the often twisted humour is made genuinely funny by the actors. The logic and consequenses of the characters schemes seem secondary. For example, it doesn’t appear to bother Santiago that his wife would be a baby and not in fact ""Viviana"" in any way other than genetically. In fact he misses her to such an extreme that its hard not to end up rooting for him to see her.
There is a secondary plot about another scientist seeking to undermine Murray's work. This comes into play as Santiago and Murray attempt to source the equipment they need for their experiment. Ultimately and perhaps predictably, the entire scheme ends up in danger of falling apart and that's when the creativity in the film shines. The character work and script development keep the characters moving along their dramatic arch in a funny and unique way.[2][3][4][5][6]",comedy quirky dark comedy santiago morale manuel rodriguez saenz engineer unable come term passing wife viviana dalal badr die cancer santiago rent room house struggle financial affair marriage sort quickly suicidal obsess late wife watch video ipad build shrine room santiago particular keep thing neat tidy organize lead clash housemate landlord murray clinton lee pons total slob spend time underwear living room house surround trash clutter santiago discover murray actually disgrace geneticist time hand murray rise star cloning field catch conduct illegal experiment fire itch saddle devise plan involve housemate laura freya ravensbergen clone santiago dead wife bring life laura lose waitressing job unable pay debt present relative financial windfall role reluctantly agree scheme surrogate bizarro cloning experiment film unique offbeat twisted humour genuinely funny actor logic consequense character scheme secondary example appear bother santiago wife baby fact viviana way genetically fact miss extreme hard end root secondary plot scientist seek undermine murray work come play santiago murray attempt source equipment need experiment ultimately predictably entire scheme end danger fall apart creativity film shine character work script development character move dramatic arch funny unique

Dhamaal,comedy,"Four good for nothing friends Roy, Adi , Boman and Manav are kicked out of their house by their landlady for not paying their rents. Desperate to earn money, they devise up a plan. Adi tells Manav to steal a painting from the house. They decide to sell it to the son of the late Businessman Dwiwedi. But, however, Manav accidentally picks up a blank painting not knowing the reality. They humorously sell the painting for Rs.20,000 to him. They then pick up the original painting with the intention to sell it to Mr. Aggarwal not knowing that he has been murdered. The case is handled by Inspector Kulkarni. He learns that before Mr. Aggrawal was murdered he was speaking on the phone to somebody and he mentioned the words 'horse' and 'grass'. He interprets these words to be some code language. Unfortunately the four arrive at Agrawal's residence. Kulkarni demands to see the painting. Seeing the horse and grass he immediately arrests them.
While travelling on the highway Kulkarni drops the four on the road after realising that they are innocent. The four are overjoyed until they suddenly witness a car accident of Don Bose. He tells them that he has hidden a treasure of 10 Crores in the St. Sebastian garden in Goa under a big 'W'. He tells them to divide the money equally among themselves and then dies. They come across Inspector Kabir Nayak who has been trying to arrest Bose for the past ten years. He tries to extract information from the four but in vain, they escape from there and decide to travel to Goa. Desperate for his promotion, Kabir is determined to capture the four. All four friends steal Boman's car which belongs to his father Nari (Asrani), who loves his car more than his son and threw his son out after he damaged his car. The friends manage to steal their car but not before hitting Nari on the head and making him unconscious. Unfortunately, Roy loses control of the car in a forest and hits it against a tree breaking both headlights. They decide to spend the night in the car. The next day Kabir is transferred to Yavatmal for failing to capture Bose. Furious he walks towards his table where Nari is waiting for him to file a complaint against his son for stealing his car. He gives Kabir the photos of Boman and his car. Meanwhile all four come across a broken bridge which is the only way through the forest. They decide to jump the car but Boman is reluctant to do so. Unfortunately they manage to jump the car on the other side but it blasts off.
Kabir tracks the four down after discovering the destroyed car. He is able to learn the location of the treasure due to Manav's dumbness. He ties all four of them to a tree and sets off. However they manage to escape and it is revealed that Roy had actually cut the engine wires of Kabir's car so he must have not gone too far. They reach a dhabha and pretend to be detectives. They make the villagers believe that Kabir is a member of the Pasha gang and lures them to capture him for the reward would be Rs. 15 lakhs. Unfortunately Kabir defeats the villagers and he and the four arrive at a settlement - 60% would belong to the four and 40% would belong to Kabir. But Boman insists on having his money separately for damaging his car from the rest of the three. Consequently a fight ensues and is decided that whoever reaches the treasure first would take all the money.
All four part ways and try to reach Goa as soon as possible. Roy encounters a dacoit Babubhai (Sanjay Mishra) and agree to divide the money among themselves provided they reach Goa as soon as possible. Boman also encounters his father. Though Nari initially wants to kill his son, changes his mind after he learns about the ten crores. Adi and Manav travel together. Kabir nearly escapes death as he hangs off a cliff and is rescued by some school children whose school bus he stole. All of them go through a series of humorous adventures before reaching Goa. Unfortunately all of them (except Kabir) reach the garden at the same time. Finally Roy explains that it is useless finding the treasure alone and all agree to find the money together. They all search for the big 'W'. Manav is able to locate the Palm trees which make the shape of a 'W' when a crow poos on Adi. But Kabir arrives there and tells them to divide the money against them to which all agree. They dig there and are able to find the money. But again a fight ensues over the payment for the damage of the car. All are enraged when Adi and Manav decide to pay the money as one unit but are separate units while taking money. The fight goes on during which Kabir takes all the money and runs. He tries to escape in a hot air balloon on a beach but finds it tied to a pole. He dives in an effort to cut the rope but is beaten up by the rest who pursue him. The balloon blows off shore and all are disheartened.
Conditions change when the wind changes direction and the balloon again blows onshore. They follow the balloon in a towing van. The balloon clashes against a pole and the bag falls down. All of them try to collect as much money as they can when suddenly some spot lights focus on them and a crowd cheers loudly behind them. They are actually standing in stage where a function is being held by an organisation named 'Help Orphans'. Seeing the money everybody thinks they have come here to donate money. All of them get emotional and all decide to donate the money for the orphans. The film ends on a happy note conveying that the fate of the money was already decided. It never belonged to the four friends.

Fair Game,action,"Kathryn ""Kate"" McQuean (Cindy Crawford) is a Miami lawyer who, in the course of a divorce proceeding, attempts to seize a 157-foot freighter docked off the Florida coast in lieu of unpaid alimony.
The freighter, which is owned by criminal Emilio Juantorena (Miguel Sandoval), is the current base of operations of Ilya Pavel Kazak (Steven Berkoff), a former KGB agent who has become an international money laundering expert, and has also become the leader of a group of rogue KGB members, including Stefan (Gustav Vintas), Leonide ""Hacker"" Volkov (Paul Dillon), Navigator (Marc Macaulay), Rosa (Jenette Goldstein) and Zhukov (Olek Krupa).
When Kate is unintentionally hit by a stray bullet, Miami detective Max Kirkpatrick (William Baldwin) is assigned to the case. Then an attempt is made on Kate's life by Kazak, who — after killing Juantorena — assembles his team into tracking and killing Kate; Max then becomes her protector.
Kate, Max, and two of his colleagues stay at a hotel. They order pizza, but Volkov traces the order, and Rosa and two henchmen infiltrate the hotel and kill Max's colleagues. Max manages to kill the whole hit squad (except Rosa) and he and Kate then leave. After Max contacts his superior, Lt. Meyerson (Christopher McDonald), FBI agents are sent to escort them. The ""agents"" turn out to be henchmen working for Kazak, and Max's partner and long-time friend Detective Louis Aragon (John Bedford Lloyd) is killed in the process. After killing some of Kazak's men, Max and Kate travel throughout Florida, trying to avoid Kazak and find out why he wants Kate dead.
However, their jeep breaks down on a freeway and they call a tow truck to come pick them up. Volkov and Stefan show up to kill them, while Kazak splits from them to deal with Max's cousin, who has been feeding them information regarding Kazak and his past activities in Cuba. Kate and Max are forced to run with the tow truck while their jeep is still hooked onto it. After a long chase and gunfight, Kate steps hard on the brakes while Max steers the wheel of the truck, unhooking their car and causing it to crash into Volkov's and Stefan's SUV, killing both of them.
One of Kate's clients is the ex-wife of Emilio Juantorena, and she is trying to repossess the boat to pay for her divorce settlement. She stumbled on something about the ship and is the main reason why Kazak and his crew put a target on Kate.
Regardless, Kazak has kidnapped Kate and taken her to the freighter while Rosa and Zhukov are sent to kill Max. They accidentally kill the Navigator and Max shoots both of them. Rosa, however, has a bulletproof vest on, and Max only kills her after a long fight. Max then boards the freighter in an attempt to rescue Kate. Max and Kate blow up the freighter, killing Kazak. They jump off of the boat just in time to watch it blow up and sink. They climb aboard the boat Kirkpatrick used to reach the freighter and start to kiss passionately.

He and the sisters form an army and head for Tervon's castle, but are ambushed by the king's armies. After a serious battle Hazen faces and easily defeats Tervon in a duel. It is also revealed the dragon which attacked the village earlier is actually controlled by Tervon, who calls upon it to make his escape when he is defeated in the duel against Hazen.

Reservoir Dogs,crime drama,"Eight men eat breakfast at a Los Angeles diner before carrying out a diamond heist. Six of them use aliases: Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, and Mr. White. The others are mob boss Joe Cabot and his son and underboss ""Nice Guy"" Eddie Cabot, who are responsible for planning the job.
After the heist, White flees the crime scene with Orange, who was shot during the escape and is bleeding severely. At one of Joe's warehouses, White and Orange rendezvous with Pink, who believes that the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them. White informs him that Brown is dead, Blue and Blonde are missing, and Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist; White is furious that Joe, his old friend, would employ such a ""psychopath"". Pink has hidden the diamonds nearby; he argues with White over whether or not they should get medical attention for Orange. Blonde arrives with a kidnapped policeman, Marvin Nash.
Some time earlier, Blonde meets with the Cabots. Blonde has completed a four-year jail sentence. To reward him for not having given Joe's name to the authorities for a lighter sentence, they recruit him for the job.
In the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information. Eddie arrives and orders them to retrieve the diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles, leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange. Nash denies knowledge, but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture, cutting off his ear with a straight razor. He is about to set Nash on fire, but is shot dead by Orange. Orange explains to Nash that he is an undercover police officer and that the police will arrive soon.
Hours earlier, Brown is shot and killed while escaping from the crime scene with Orange and White. When Orange and White attempt to steal another car, Orange is shot by the driver of the car, whom he shoots and kills in response.
In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, who he suspects is the traitor behind the setup, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.
Pink, the only person who has not been shot, takes the diamonds and turns to flee only to get arrested by the arriving cops. As White cradles the dying Orange in his arms, Orange confesses that he is a police officer. White holds his gun against Orange's head. The police storm the warehouse and order White to drop his gun.

Life is Sweet,comedy drama,"Andy (Jim Broadbent), a senior chef in a large London catering facility, buys a dilapidated fast-food van from a disreputable acquaintance named Patsy (Stephen Rea). He plans to clean, restore and put it into service on a local fast-food round. Wendy (Alison Steadman), his hard-working, good-natured and innuendo-prone wife, is sensibly sceptical about the project but understands her husband's ambitions. Their twin 22-year-old daughters (Natalie and Nicola) have profoundly different attitudes: tomboyish Natalie, who works as a plumber's mate (Claire Skinner), thinks it is a good idea if it will make her father happy, whereas the bitter, shut-in Nicola (Jane Horrocks), contemptuously and typically dismisses Andy as a ""Capitalist!"" Late at night, an anguished Nicola binges on chocolate and snacks, then forces herself to vomit. Natalie – awake in the next room – overhears her.
Aubrey (Timothy Spall), a hyperactive but emotionally labile family friend, is opening a Parisian-themed restaurant named The Regret Rien. Wendy accepts a part-time job as waitress in the restaurant, but her and Andy's initial confidence in the scheme is undermined by Aubrey's unorthodox approach to the interior décor (a cluttered, half-realised combination of outmoded French clichés, such as a bicycle in the bay window, and of tasteless Victoriana such as a stuffed cat's head framed by broken accordion sconces) and by his menu. His singularly grotesque interpretation of the excesses of nouvelle cuisine includes dishes such as saveloy on a bed of lychees, liver in lager and pork cyst.
During the afternoon, whilst the rest of the family are out at work, Nicola's lover (unnamed, played by David Thewlis) comes to the family home to have sex with her. It appears that Nicola can only be aroused by a combination of light bondage and the consumption of chocolate spread from her chest – a practice to which he only reluctantly agrees. He ultimately loses patience with her, accusing her of being ""a bit vacant"" and incapable of having a sincere, adult conversation or allowing herself to enjoy his companionship. She calls his bluff and loses: frustrated but resolute, he leaves her and her fragile emotional state deteriorates even further.
The opening night of The Regret Rien is a disaster. Wendy volunteers her help when it becomes clear that Aubrey's waitress has let him down – she has gone to Prague with her boyfriend. And Aubrey forgot to advertise the opening of the restaurant, with the result that no customers turn up. Aubrey gets hopelessly drunk, takes to the pavement and rails against the world, tells Wendy that he fancies her, starts taking his clothes off and passes out, 'a quivering, sobbing gelatinous blob of disappointment.'[2] Wendy is forced to deal not only with him but with his glum and passive sous-chef/dogsbody, Paula (Moya Brady).
Meanwhile, Andy and Patsy have gone to their local pub, where Andy gets uncharacteristically but emphatically drunk and ends up sleeping inside the decrepit fast-food van in his driveway. Wendy returns home from the disastrous opening night of Aubrey's restaurant to find him there: unnerved by her bizarre evening, she loses her temper with the whole family.
Phlegmatic and dry-humoured Natalie enjoys her unconventional work as a plumber, the simple pleasures of a pint and a game of pool, and dreams of visiting the US. In contrast, the fidgety and isolated Nicola becomes increasingly agitated, aggressive and reclusive, and Wendy finally confronts her. During the course of their long and anguished confrontation, Wendy makes it clear to Nicola that she is deeply worried about her, for example, wondering why she makes no attempt to get involved with the causes she claims to believe in. She tells Nicola of the struggle she and Andy endured to care for their baby daughters – how it meant she never went to college and Andy working in a ""job he hates."" It emerges that during an earlier phase of Nicola's bulimia, she almost starved to death. Ashamed and angry, Nicola is convinced that Wendy and the rest of the family hate her. Instead, as the exasperated Wendy tells her, ""We don't hate you! We love you, you stupid girl!"" and leaves the room, deeply upset. The brittle behavioural armour with which Nicola has protected her psyche is now shattered and she breaks down sobbing.
Meanwhile, Andy is seen running his kitchen at work with energy and authority but slips on a spoon, breaking his ankle.

Min frequently argues with fisherman Bill (Wallace Beery). Despite Bill's near-constant drinking, Min and he care for each other. Bill and she are the only ones who know the identity of Nancy's real, still living, mother.
Min does her best to raise Nancy and keep her from learning about the real activities of the people who live and work on the docks. Despite not having much extra money or a home outside her inn, Min does her best to raise Nancy into a young lady. She does everything she can to make sure Nancy is never around when Bella arrives for a visit.
Nancy loves Min as her own mother and frequently skips school to be with her. After repeatedly dealing with the truant officer, Min uses the money she had hidden in her room to send Nancy to a fancy boarding school. She hopes the school will teach Nancy better manners than what she had been picking up from Bill and the others on the docks. The schooling works and Nancy returns to Min with good manners, an education, and the news that she is now engaged to a very wealthy man. She wants Min to attend the wedding.
Min is thrilled until she finds out that Bella has returned. Seeing how happy Nancy is to be getting married (and the wedding will be taking place in a few days), Min deliberately argues with Nancy and says terrible things she does not mean for Nancy to immediately leave.

When Bella attacks Min with a hot curling iron and attempts to leave, Min takes a hidden gun and shoots her dead. Min drops the gun and flees the room. Bill, knowing what was going on, tries to help Min, but she leaves the inn. Min wants to see Nancy one last time. She sees the happy couple as they are about to board a boat to their honeymoon. Min watches, but decides not to let Nancy know she is there and stays hidden in the crowd. Two police officers quietly confront Min about the shooting at the inn. Min does not say much.

Some days later, Josh's girlfriend, Mattie Webber (Kristen Bell), visits his apartment, seeing evidence that it has not been well kept. Josh tells Mattie to wait in the kitchen while he walks off. While waiting she finds Josh's pet cat, locked in a closet and dying from severe malnutrition. But when she rushes to tell him, she finds he has committed suicide by hanging himself with an Ethernet cable.
Mattie and her friends begin to receive online messages from Josh asking for help but assume that Josh's computer is still on and that a virus is creating the messages. Mattie learns that Josh's computer has been sold to Dex McCarthy (Ian Somerhalder), who finds a number of strange videos on the computer. Mattie receives a package that Josh mailed two days prior to his death. Inside are rolls of red tape and a message telling her that the tape keeps ""them"" out, although he does not know why. Later, Dex visits Mattie and shows her video messages Josh was sending to Ziegler. Josh had hacked Ziegler's computer system and then distributed a virus. This virus had unlocked a portal that connected the realm of the living to the realm of the dead. Josh believed he had coded a counter to the virus and wanted to meet Ziegler at the library. Josh's counter-program is found on a memory stick taped inside the PC case with red tape.
Dex and Mattie visit Ziegler and find his room entirely plastered in red tape. They believe the red tape keeps the spirits out. Ziegler tells them of a project he worked on where he found ""frequencies no one knew existed."" Opening these frequencies somehow allowed the spirits to travel to the world of the living. Ziegler also tells them that these spirits ""take away your will to live"" and where to find the main server infected with the virus.
Dex and Mattie find the server and upload Josh's fix, causing the system to crash and the spirits to vanish. Moments later, however, the system reboots and the spirits return leaving Mattie and Dex with no option but to flee the city by car. Over the car radio, Mattie and Dex hear a report from the Army announcing the location of several ""safe zones"" where there are no Internet connections, cell phones, or televisions. As Dex and Mattie drive to a safe zone, the film concludes with a voice-over from Mattie saying ""We can never go back. The cities are theirs. Our lives are different now. What was meant to connect us to one another instead connected us to forces that we could have never imagined. The world we knew is gone, but the will to live never dies.

Island of Lost Women,science fiction,"Mark Bradley (Richards) is a radio commentator whose pilot, Joe Walker (Smith), is flying him across the South Pacific to a conference in Australia.
Engine trouble develops, and Walker must make a forced landing on the beach of a small, uncharted island inhabited by Dr. Paul Lujan (Napier). On the island with Lujan are his three naive daughters, who have never known another man except their father.
Lujan, unfriendly to the point of hostility, orders the intruders to leave his island, but one of their aircraft's two engines is too badly damaged for them to be able to comply without first making repairs. He grants them a couple days in order to do so. In the meantime he grudgingly introduces Bradley and Walker to his trio of young, beautiful daughters, Venus (Stevenson), Urana (Jergens), and Mercuria (Blair). The two men soon learn that Dr. Lujan was an atomic scientist who fled the civilized world with his family because he fears the havoc being caused by the discovery of nuclear energy.
To the doctor's disapproval, his two older daughters easily fall in love with the two attractive strangers and try to help them, while the third, 16 and jealous of her sisters, tries to foil their plans. This forces them to make a choice between staying on the island with their father or returning with the two men to a civilization they have only experienced via short wave radio broadcasts.

Frankenstein Created Woman,horror,"A man is taken from a cart and taunts the police and the priest escorting him. He is sentenced to death by the guillotine for murder. From the place of execution, the man sees his son, Hans, and begs that he should not see him die. The priest approaches the boy but Hans runs away. The priest returns to the last rites. From a distance, Hans watches as his father is positioned under the blade. He yells, ""Papa!"" Then the blade falls, and Hans flees.
Some years later, Hans Werner (Robert Morris) is working as an assistant to Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing), helped by Dr Hertz (Thorley Walters) who is in the process of discovering a way of trapping the soul of a recently deceased person. Frankenstein believes he can transfer that soul into another recently deceased body to restore it to life.
Hans is now also the lover of Christina (Susan Denberg), daughter of innkeeper Kleve. Christina's entire left side is disfigured and partly paralysed. Young dandies Anton (Peter Blythe), Johann (Derek Fowlds) and Karl (Barry Warren) frequent Kleve's inn where they taunt Christina and refuse to pay. Johann threatens to have his father revoke Kleve's license if he complains. The three insist that they be served by Christina and mock her for her deformities. The taunting angers Hans, who gets in a fight with the three of them and cuts Anton's face with a knife.
Eventually Kleve throws the dandies out for non-payment. They return in the night to steal wine from his inn. Kleve catches them and they beat him to death. Hans, the son of a murderer known for his short temper, is convicted. Despite the Baron and Hertz's defences against the accusations, Hans is executed by the guillotine, much to Anton, Johann and Karl's delight. Seeing this as an opportunity, Frankenstein gets hold of Hans' fresh corpse and traps his soul.
Distraught over Hans's death and feeling the guilt for not defending him, Christina drowns herself by jumping off a bridge. The peasants bring her body to Dr Hertz to see if he can do anything. Frankenstein and Hertz transfer Hans' soul into her body. Over months of complex and intensive treatment, they completely cure her physical deformities. The result is a physically healthy female with no memory. She keeps asking who she is. Frankenstein insists on telling her nothing but her name and keeping her in Hertz's house. Despite coming to her senses regarding her identity, Christine is taken over by the spirit of the vengeful Hans.
She kills Anton and Karl driven mostly by the ghostly insistence of Hans. Frankenstein and Hertz become rather suspicious of her behaviour surrounding the killings and take her to where Hans was executed. However, they believe she subconsciously retains her memories of her father's death rather than of Hans. By the time Frankenstein realises the truth, he finds her already murdering Johann. Upon holding the severed head of Hans, the ghostly voice tells Christina she has avenged his death. Despite the Baron's pleas, the horrified Christina knows she now has no one and nothing left to live for, and so drowns herself again.

The ringmaster/proprietor of the struggling circus gives him a tryout the next day, but the Tramp fails miserably. However, when the property men quit because they have not been paid, he gets hired on the spot to take their place. Once again, he inadvertently creates comic mayhem during a show.

Chimpanzee,nature documentary,"Oscar is the nickname of a young chimpanzee in his toddler years. He is part of a close-knit tribe of chimpanzees. They occupy a forest territory which is rich in native fruits, nuts, and figs, among other things. The chimps hunt small tree monkeys, and they also eat termites collected with primitive tools made from sticks. They also use rocks as tools to crack nuts. Oscar is tended by his mother, nicknamed Isha, and from her he begins learning many things about how to survive in the jungle. In the chaos of an attempted raid by a rival gang of chimpanzees led by 'Scar', Isha is injured and separated from the group and her son. As told by the narrator, Isha is most probably the victim of a nocturnal leopard.
Unaware of his mother's death, Oscar spends much of his time looking for her. He finds trouble in recalling the things she taught him and begins to lose weight quickly. He attempts to find another mother to take care of him. However, none of the females can afford him, already having young of their own to raise. As time goes on, Oscar is rejected by nearly every chimp in the group, until the only one left to ask is the tough-skinned leader Freddy. However, as Oscar follows the leader and imitates him, it is soon revealed that the unlikely duo may work out. The two gradually warm up to each other more and more, until one day Freddy lets Oscar ride on his back, something normally only mother chimps do.

Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,comedy,"Ace Ventura is an eccentric Miami-based private detective who specializes in retrieving tame or captive animals. However, he struggles to pay his rent, and is often mocked by the Miami Police Department, led by Lieutenant Lois Einhorn, who finds Ventura insufferable. Two weeks before the Miami Dolphins are to play in the Super Bowl, their mascot, a bottlenose dolphin named Snowflake, is kidnapped. Melissa Robinson, the Dolphins’ chief publicist, hires Ventura to find Snowflake.
Searching Snowflake’s tank for clues, Ventura finds a rare triangular-cut, orange amber stone, which he recognizes as a part of a 1984 AFC Championship ring. Ace suspects a billionaire, Ronald Camp, may have stolen Snowflake. Ventura and Melissa sneak in to Camp’s party, Ventura mistaking a shark for Snowflake and is nearly eaten. Camp apologises, shaking Ventura’s hand, with his hand wearing a ring with an amber stone identical to the one Ventura found. Ruling out Camp, Ventura concludes that a member of the 1984 Miami Dolphins line-up may have kidnapped Snowflake, and will be able to identify the culprit by their rings. However, he discovers all of the team members’ rings are intact.
Roger Podacter, the team’s head of operations, mysteriously dies after falling from his apartment balcony. Einhorn declares it a suicide, but Ventura proves it to have been murder. Ventura comes across an old photograph of the football team, discovering an unfamiliar player named Ray Finkle, who was only added in during midseason. Finkle missed the field goal kick at the end of Super Bowl XVII, which cost the Dolphins the championship, ruining his career.
Visiting Finkle’s parents, Ventura learns that Finkle blames Dan Marino for the end of his career, and was subsequently committed to a mental hospital. Marino is kidnapped himself shortly after. Ventura visits Einhorn, pitching his theory that Finkle kidnapped both Marino and Snowflake in an act of revenge, since the dolphin has been given Finkle's old team number. He also theorises that Finkle murdered Podacter. Einhorn compliments Ventura and kisses him.
Ventura and Melissa go to the mental hospital, the former posing as a potential patient, where he uncovers a newspaper article in Finkle’s possessions about a missing hiker named Lois Einhorn. Ventura realises that Einhorn is in fact Finkle: Finkle used the fact that the actual Einhorn was missing and presumed dead (with no body found), and took on her identity, had surgery to change his gender, and began a career with the Miami Police Department to eventually get revenge on Marino and the Dolphins. On Super Bowl Sunday, Ventura follows Einhorn to an abandoned yacht storage facility where she has Marino and Snowflake held hostage. Einhorn calls the police, framing Ventura for the kidnappings. Melissa and Ventura’s friend, police officer Emilio, stage a hostage situation to get the police to listen to Ventura.
Ventura strips Einhorn of his clothes to expose his failure to completely change her sex, but fails until Marino points out a bulge in the back of his underwear, actually Finkle’s unchanged privates hidden out of view. This confirms that Finkle murdered Podacter after the latter had discovered Finkle’s secret. Einhorn is arrested by the police after attacking Ventura, and Finkle’s ring is identified to have a missing stone. Marino and Snowflake are welcomed back during half-time at the Super Bowl in a match between the Dolphins and the Philadelphia Eagles. Ventura tries to retrieve a valuable albino pigeon, but it is scared off by the Eagles’ mascot Swoop, causing Ventura to attack him in retaliation.",comedy ace ventura eccentric miami base private detective specialize retrieve tame captive animal struggle pay rent mock miami police department lead lieutenant lois einhorn find ventura insufferable week miami dolphin play super bowl mascot bottlenose dolphin name snowflake kidnap melissa robinson dolphin chief publicist hire ventura find snowflake search snowflake tank clue ventura find rare triangular cut orange amber stone recognize afc championship ring ace suspect billionaire ronald camp steal snowflake ventura melissa sneak camp party ventura mistake shark snowflake nearly eat camp apologise shake ventura hand hand wear ring amber stone identical ventura find rule camp ventura conclude member miami dolphin line kidnap snowflake able identify culprit ring discover team member ring intact roger podacter team head operation mysteriously die fall apartment balcony einhorn declare suicide ventura prove murder ventura come old photograph football team discover unfamiliar player name ray finkle add midseason finkle miss field goal kick end super bowl xvii cost dolphin championship ruin career visit finkle parent ventura learn finkle blame dan marino end career subsequently commit mental hospital marino kidnap shortly ventura visit einhorn pitch theory finkle kidnap marino snowflake act revenge dolphin give finkle old team number theorise finkle murder podacter einhorn compliment ventura kiss ventura melissa mental hospital posing potential patient uncover newspaper article finkle possession missing hiker name lois einhorn ventura realise einhorn fact finkle finkle fact actual einhorn miss presume dead body find take identity surgery change gender begin career miami police department eventually revenge marino dolphin super bowl sunday ventura follow einhorn abandon yacht storage facility marino snowflake hold hostage einhorn call police frame ventura kidnapping melissa ventura friend police officer emilio stage hostage situation police listen ventura ventura strip einhorn clothe expose failure completely change sex fail marino point bulge underwear actually finkle unchanged private hide view confirm finkle murder podacter discover finkle secret einhorn arrest police attack ventura finkle ring identify miss stone marino snowflake welcome half time super bowl match dolphin philadelphia eagle ventura try retrieve valuable albino pigeon scare eagle mascot swoop cause ventura attack retaliation
Crime Unlimited,crime thriller,"The Merrick gang pull off a diamond robbery and murder a police officer investigating their crimes. A paper with the cryptic writing ""AD 1935"" is found on the murdered officer's body. Outsmarted by the gang, the police assistant commissioner and Inspector Cardby decide to have Pete Borden, a new recruit who the gang would not know, go undercover and join the gang.
When he enters a casino, Natascha is sent to check him out. He pretends to be looking for a fence to sell his stolen jewelry. Reassured, the gang recruits him. Merrick (the gang's mysterious leader who never lets anyone see him face to face) first assigns him to check on Delaney, a crooked bookie. Pete then meets Newell, a lawyer. The gang then installs Pete in a flat; he tosses a note containing the address to a policeman when no one is looking. Two police detectives let the flat opposite. One of them is deaf, and equipped with binoculars, can read Pete's lips when he silently mouths what he has discovered.
The gang plans to steal the necklace of prominent socialite Lady Mead at a party she is giving. Pete goes to the party with Natascha, while the police attend the party undercover, and send Lady Sybil, a society gossip columnist, to observe. At the party, Pete runs into Conway Addison, a lawyer. The lights go out, and when it goes back on, Natascha has escaped with the stolen necklace. Inspector Cardby pretends to arrest Pete, but lets him go once they are outside.
Natascha later visits Pete and tells him that she wants to leave the gang, but one of the crooks is eavesdropping. She claims Merrick sent her to test Pete. The gangster checks with his boss and finds out she was lying.
With his plans being tipped off to the police, Merrick soon suspects Pete. This is confirmed when the police notify the next target, who notifies Merrick. The mastermind pretends to accept Pete's proposal for a robbery. However, while the police are waiting for them there, the gang actually strike elsewhere.
Pete is taken to an isolated country house. Merrick finally lets Pete see him, as he intends to kill the policeman; it is Conway Addison. Addison explains he took to crime after becoming bored with his job. While Natascha is being taken to the same place, she causes the car to go off the road. She then tells a police officer where she was heading. To avoid tipping Merrick off, she shows up at the house. Merrick, having decided to retire, tries to gas the whole gang, Pete and Natasha to cover his tracks. However, Pete manages to break out of the locked room, and the police arrive in time to shoot Conway and arrest the rest of his gang.",crime thriller merrick gang pull diamond robbery murder police officer investigate crime paper cryptic writing ad find murder officer body outsmart gang police assistant commissioner inspector cardby decide pete borden new recruit gang know undercover join gang enter casino natascha send check pretend look fence sell steal jewelry reassure gang recruit merrick gang mysterious leader let face face assign check delaney crooked bookie pete meet newell lawyer gang install pete flat toss note contain address policeman look police detective let flat opposite deaf equip binocular read pete lip silently mouth discover gang plan steal necklace prominent socialite lady mead party give pete go party natascha police attend party undercover send lady sybil society gossip columnist observe party pete run conway addison lawyer light go natascha escape steal necklace inspector cardby pretend arrest pete let outside natascha later visit pete tell want leave gang crook eavesdropping claim merrick send test pete gangster check boss find lie plan tip police merrick soon suspect pete confirm police notify target notifies merrick mastermind pretend accept pete proposal robbery police wait gang actually strike pete take isolated country house merrick finally let pete intend kill policeman conway addison addison explain take crime bore job natascha take place cause car road tell police officer head avoid tip merrick show house merrick having decide retire try gas gang pete natasha cover track pete manage break locked room police arrive time shoot conway arrest rest gang
3 Ninjas Kick Back,"action, family","Rocky, Colt and Tum-Tum are experiencing the pains of growing up prior to a trip to Japan planned with their grandfather Mori Shintaro, who hopes to take them to a martial arts tournament of which he was the victor 50 years ago. Only Tum-Tum seems interested in going, and even then, only out of interest in seeing sumo wrestlers due to how much food they get to eat. He tells the boys he hopes to return a dagger awarded to him at the tournament when he defeated a boy named Koga, so that it may be presented to the incumbent victor. In Japan, a man (later revealed to be Koga) breaks into a museum and steals a sword before escaping via hang glider. Meanwhile, back at Mori's house, a trio of burglars led by Koga's nephew Glam try to break into the house to steal the dagger. The boys manage to drive them off, counting it as an ordinary robbery attempt.
At a baseball game, Rocky seems too focused on a cute girl named Lisa D. Marino to pitch properly. Tum-Tum causes constant breaks due to getting snacks, and Colt's short temper causes a fight with the opposing team that grows so large that the umpire calls off the game until the next week, driving a nail into the boys' plans to travel. Grandpa leaves alone, but the boys' father Sam accidentally gives him Tum-Tum's suitcase by mistake. Once he arrives in Japan, Mori's taxi is rear-ended by Glam and his friends who steal his bag. After hearing from Mori at the hospital, the boys discover their bags had been switched and have the dagger. They arrange a trip with Mori's credit card and meet him in Japan. He instructs the boys to give it to the master of the tournament. Glam and his friends record the conversation and deliver it to Koga, who punishes them for not retrieving the dagger. At the tournament, Colt takes the place of a fallen competitor but is promptly beaten by a girl named Miyo, wounding his pride. She helps them deliver the dagger to the Grand Master, and allows the boys to stay with her and her mother. She has a love of baseball but is not very good. The boys offer to train her in baseball if she teaches them some of her martial arts skill.
Koga attempts to trap the boys and retrieve the dagger himself by pretending to be the Grand Master, but the boys and Miyo catch onto his scheme. They face several adversaries before they are finally captured. Meanwhile, Mori is kidnapped from the hospital by Koga's assistant after fleeing Glam and the others. Koga forces Mori to tell him the location of the Cave of Gold; an urban legend which the sword and dagger are the keys to open. Fearing the safety for his grandchildren, Mori agrees to aid Koga. Soon after, the children come up with a plan and escape Koga's compound on hang gliders, arriving at the cave shortly after the adults. Inside, Koga and Mori realize the legend is true after they encounter walls and monuments of gold within. While the two battle each other, the boys and Miyo drop in on them and Koga pulls a gun. Using Mori's lesson on focus, Colt throws a ball bearing into the muzzle of the gun, causing it to backfire and start a cave in. The group flees the cave, and Koga, now realizing the price of his greed, apologizes and leaves the group unharmed. Rocky realizes that they are a day ahead of America and that they can still make it home by the championship game.
At the game, the boys overcome their flaws. Down by two in the last inning, one of the opposing team antagonists gets a hit off Rocky's pitch which is almost a home run, until a recent roster add, revealed to be Miyo, catches the ball. In the bottom of the inning, Colt focuses and hits a home run, allowing all three boys to score and win the game. The bullies face them down after the game, and he picks Miyo to assault for ruining his home run. Despite Tum-Tum's warning that ""she's just a girl"", he screams as she readies to attack him and the screen goes dark as he is beaten up soundly.",action family rocky colt tum tum experience pain grow prior trip japan plan grandfather mori shintaro hope martial art tournament victor year ago tum tum interested go interest see sumo wrestler food eat tell boy hope return dagger award tournament defeat boy name koga present incumbent victor japan man later reveal koga break museum steal sword escape hang glider mori house trio burglar lead koga nephew glam try break house steal dagger boy manage drive count ordinary robbery attempt baseball game rocky focused cute girl name lisa marino pitch properly tum tum cause constant break get snack colt short temper cause fight oppose team grow large umpire call game week drive nail boy plan travel grandpa leave boy father sam accidentally give tum tum suitcase mistake arrive japan mori taxi rear end glam friend steal bag hear mori hospital boy discover bag switch dagger arrange trip mori credit card meet japan instruct boy master tournament glam friend record conversation deliver koga punish retrieve dagger tournament colt take place fall competitor promptly beat girl name miyo wound pride help deliver dagger grand master allow boy stay mother love baseball good boy offer train baseball teach martial art skill koga attempt trap boy retrieve dagger pretend grand master boy miyo catch scheme face adversary finally capture mori kidnap hospital koga assistant flee glam koga force mori tell location cave gold urban legend sword dagger key open fear safety grandchild mori agree aid koga soon child come plan escape koga compound hang glider arrive cave shortly adult inside koga mori realize legend true encounter wall monument gold battle boy miyo drop koga pull gun mori lesson focus colt throw ball bear muzzle gun cause backfire start cave group flee cave koga realize price greed apologize leave group unharmed rocky realize day ahead america home championship game game boy overcome flaw inning oppose team antagonist get hit rocky pitch home run recent roster add reveal miyo catch ball inning colt focus hit home run allow boy score win game bully face game pick miyo assault ruin home run despite tum tum warning girl scream ready attack screen go dark beat soundly
Clockers,drama,"In a Brooklyn, New York, New York City, New York housing project, a group of clockers — street-level drug dealers — sell drugs for Rodney Little (Delroy Lindo), a local drug lord. Rodney tells Ronald ""Strike"" Dunham (Mekhi Phifer), one of his lead clockers, that another dealer, Darryl Adams (Steve White), is stealing from him and Little wants Strike to kill Darryl Adams. Strike then meets with his brother, Victor Dunham (Isaiah Washington) and tries to persuade Victor to kill Darryl Adams.
Rocco Klein (Harvey Keitel) and Larry Mazilli (John Turturro), homicide detectives, ride to the scene of Darryl Adams' murder. Larry and Rocco receive a phone call from another detective who says a man has confessed at a local church that he killed Darryl. The police meet Strike's older brother Victor at the church and take him in for questioning. In the interrogation room, Victor tells Rocco that he shot Darryl Adams in self-defense. Rocco finds holes in this story and starts looking into Victor's background which includes two jobs, a wife, two children, no criminal record, and aspirations to move out of the projects; Rocco comes to the conclusion that Victor is covering for his younger brother.
Rodney accosts Strike for not killing Darryl Adams, with Errol Barnes, Rodney Little's enforcer, chastising Strike for getting Victor to do it. Later, Rodney Little tells Strike a story of a younger Rodney and an younger Errol (which goes to a flashback), where Errol threatened Rodney at gunpoint to kill a dealer. Rodney kills the dealer, and (back to Rodney and Strike) Rodney Little tells Strike the reason Errol forced him at gunpoint to do it was so that Errol Barnes could hold something over Rodney Little, if he ever decided to tell on him, which was why he told Strike to kill Darryl Adams.
Rocco pressures Strike but Victor sticks to his story, so Rocco convinces Rodney that Strike has confessed and informed on Rodney's drug ring. Rocco arrests Rodney and then implicates Strike in front of his crew. Strike tries to play it off and deny that he was involved in Rodney's arrest, and his crew begins to turn on Strike, leading to the crew labeling Strike a snitch. Rodney calls Errol, advises that he is in jail and Rodney puts a hit out on Strike. Strike gets together some money and decides to leave town. As Strike walks to his car, he sees Errol sitting on his car, deducting that Errol is there to kill him. Strike hides behind a fence, but a younger boy who admired Strike, Tyrone, rides up to Errol on a bike and shoots him dead with Strike's gun. Later, Tyrone is taken into custody. With Rocco, Tyrone's mother and Andre listening, Tyrone confesses that he got the gun from Strike. Andre storms out of the interrogation room, and proceeds to look for Strike.
Andre angrily beats Strike in front of the whole project, and threatens the on looking bystanders with a gun to stay back. Andre threatens to kill Strike if he ever talk to or even looks at the young boy again. As Andre says this to Strike, Rodney pulls up, which leads to Strike jumping in his own car and driving to the precinct, with Rodney following. Strike runs into Rocco (who now has an arrest warrant for Strike), and runs into the precinct as Rodney pulls up. Rocco tries to intimidate Strike into confessing to the murder, and Rocco loses his composure when Strike continues to change his story. When Rocco grabs Strike and throws him against the wall, Strike's mother walks in with Mazzilli and Victor's wife. She advises Rocco that Victor confessed to the murder immediately when he got home, and how Victor was physically unable to leave his bed. Strike asks his mom what happened to the bail money he gave Victor's wife, which leads to Strike's mom angrily throwing the money in Strike's face. As this is going on, Rodney proceeds to damage Strike's car (going as far as breaking the windows, damaging the doors, and urinating in the car). Left with no other options and unable to go home, Strike asks Rocco to drive him to Pennsylvania Station.
As they are sitting in a car, Rocco threatens Strike that if he ever sees him again, he will arrest him, let Andre beat him down, then arrest Rodney on the same charges and he will make sure Rodney and Strike share a cell and a bed in prison. Strike boards a train and leaves town. While Tyrone is playing inside his apartment with the train set that Strike gave him, outside the apartment, Rocco and Mazzilli responds to a homicide of Scientific, one of the guys in Strike's old crew.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,adventure,"In 1957, Indiana Jones and his partner George ""Mac"" McHale are kidnapped by Soviet agents under Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko, who infiltrate a warehouse labeled ""Warehouse 51"" and force Jones to locate a mummified corpse recovered from a crash site. Upon its discovery, Mac reveals he is a double agent working for the Soviets. Jones escapes and unsuccessfully attempts to retrieve the body. After a fight with Spalko's sadistic henchman, Colonel Antonin Dovchenko, Jones escapes to a model town at the Nevada Test Site minutes before an atomic bomb test, and takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator. Jones is rescued, decontaminated, and apprehended by FBI agents, who suspect him of working for the Soviets; though freed on the recommendation of General Ross, who vouches for him, he is put on indefinite leave of absence from Marshall College. His leaving also causes the dean's resignation to keep Indiana's job at the college.
Jones is approached by greaser Mutt Williams, who tells him that Harold Oxley had found a crystal skull in Peru, suffered a mental breakdown and was later kidnapped. Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator. Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, who is also held captive, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient South American language. KGB agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape them and reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles on the walls and floor of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, a Conquistador who searched for Akator. They discover the skull at the grave, with Jones reasoning that Oxley had returned it there.
Jones and Mutt are captured by Mac and the Soviets and taken to their camp in the Amazon jungle, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who reveals that Mutt is Jones's son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power, and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull, but Marion and Jones get caught into a dry sandpit, to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a CIA double-agent to regain Jones's trust, and Jones's team fights its way out of the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by siafu ants. Jones and his allies cause many of the Soviets to fall from a cliff, and they survive three waterfalls in an amphibious vehicle. Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent, is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.
The adventurers evade the city's guardians, gain access to the temple, and find it filled with artifacts from many ancient civilizations, identifying the aliens as extra-dimensional ""archaeologists"" studying the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen alien beings, one missing its skull. Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton, whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. A portal to their dimension becomes activated, and the other remaining Soviets are drawn into the portal. As Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley–who has regained his sanity–escape, the thirteen beings fuse into one, and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge, Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal. Mac is caught in the vortex while trying to scrounge some of the treasure, and even though Jones offers him his whip to pull him to safety, he willingly lets go and is sucked in. Jones and the others escape and watch as the city crumbles, revealing a flying saucer rising from under the ground and vanishing, while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.
The following year, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College and made an associate dean, and he and Marion are married. Before the wedding party leaves the chapel, a gust of wind blows Indy's brown fedora off the coat rack and deposits it at Mutt's feet. Mutt picks it up and is about to don it before Jones snatches it from his hands and puts it on with a grin.",adventure indiana jones partner george mac mchale kidnap soviet agent colonel dr irina spalko infiltrate warehouse label warehouse force jones locate mummified corpse recover crash site discovery mac reveal double agent work soviet jones escapes unsuccessfully attempt retrieve body fight spalko sadistic henchman colonel antonin dovchenko jones escape model town nevada test site minute atomic bomb test take shelter lead line refrigerator jones rescue decontaminate apprehend fbi agent suspect work soviet free recommendation general ross vouch indefinite leave absence marshall college leaving cause dean resignation indiana job college jones approach greaser mutt williams tell harold oxley find crystal skull peru suffer mental breakdown later kidnap jones tell mutt legend crystal skull find akator mutt give jones letter mother hold captive contain riddle write oxley ancient south american language kgb agent attempt capture jones mutt escape reach peru local psychiatric hospital oxley scribble wall floor cell lead grave francisco de orellana conquistador search akator discover skull grave jones reasoning oxley return jones mutt capture mac soviet take camp amazon jungle find oxley mutt mother marion ravenwood reveal mutt jones son henry jones iii spalko believe crystal skull belong alien life form hold great psychic power find skull akator grant soviet advantage psychic warfare spalko use skull jones enable understand oxley identify route akator jones ally escape skull marion jones catch dry sandpit recapture soviet oxley accidentally bring assistance way akator mac tell jones cia double agent regain jones trust jones team fight way soviet clutch dovchenko devour siafu ant jones ally cause soviet fall cliff survive waterfall amphibious vehicle jones oxley identify skull like rock formation lead akator unaware mac lie cia agent loyal spalko drop transceiver allow survive soviet track adventurer evade city guardian gain access temple find fill artifact ancient civilization identify alien extra dimensional archaeologist study different culture earth find enter chamber contain crystal skeleton thirteen alien being miss skull spalko arrive present skull skeleton alien reanimate telepathically offer reward ancient mayan oxley portal dimension activate remain soviet draw portal jones marion mutt oxley regain sanity escape thirteen being fuse process receive overwhelming knowledge spalko disintegrate suck portal mac catch vortex try scrounge treasure jones offer whip pull safety willingly let suck jones escape watch city crumble reveal fly saucer rise ground vanishing hollow valley floor leave departure flood water amazon follow year jones reinstate marshall college associate dean marion marry wedding party leave chapel gust wind blow indy brown fedora coat rack deposit mutt foot mutt pick don jones snatch hand put grin
27 Dresses,romantic comedy,"Jane Nichols (Katherine Heigl) has been a bridesmaid for 27 weddings. One night when she is attending two weddings almost simultaneously, she meets Kevin Doyle (James Marsden), who helps her get home but discusses with her his cynical views of marriage. He finds her day planner in the cab they shared. Meanwhile, Jane's sister Tess (Malin Åkerman) arrives from Europe and falls in love with Jane's boss George (Edward Burns) at first sight. Tess pretends to like the same things that George does to get him to like her. Despite being in love with George herself, Jane does not reveal the truth and her sister's courtship progresses rapidly. Soon the new couple announce that they intend to marry in three weeks and Jane becomes the wedding planner.
The reporter who agrees to cover their wedding for the society page turns out to be Kevin, who writes wedding announcements under the pseudonym Malcolm Doyle. After looking at the contents of Jane's planner, he decides to use the contents as material for a piece on the ""perpetual bridesmaid"" and hopefully be promoted to writing investigative pieces about ""real"" news.
Jane is unaware of Kevin's intentions. When he asks to interview her for his column on Tess, he gets her to try on all 27 bridesmaids dresses in her closet. He takes pictures of her in all of them and sends them with the completed article to his boss. As they get to know each other, Kevin begins to think that Jane is not as one-dimensional as he thought and asks his editor to hold his article so he can ""fix"" it.
When Kevin finds out that Jane is getting her sister's marriage fixed with the man she loves, he rebukes her. Jane agrees to one drink with Kevin and ends up getting drunk. Kevin and Jane kiss and have sex in the car. The next morning, the two go to a diner and a waitress recognizes Jane. Kevin's editor ran the article on the front page of the 'Commitments' section, despite Kevin and her settling to hold it for a while. When Jane finds out about it, she feels betrayed and is furious at him. Tess then gets angry at Jane for giving Kevin material about her, whom he describes as a bridezilla. The fight escalates when Jane sees that Tess altered their late mother's wedding dress to her own style — the last straw on Tess' string of lies to George and demands on Jane.
Despite the fight, Tess asks Jane to make a slideshow for her engagement party. Jane decides that George should know the truth about Tess and shows pictures of Tess with other men, eating ribs (as she claimed that she is a vegan, like George), holding a cat by the tail, and recoiling from George's dog (she told him that she loves dogs, but actually hates them) — in short, doing all the things she had told George that she never did. After that, Pedro, the child George mentors, tells the crowd that Tess had him clean George's apartment for money. George breaks off the engagement. Jane's friend, Casey(Judy Greer), points out that telling the truth to George and breaking their engagement at the party didn't help the situation, and that it would have been better if she had been upfront with him in the beginning. The next day, Jane confronts Tess to apologize. She is still mad with Jane, as Tess believes that Jane resented her throughout the years. Tess reveals that the reason she stayed in New York was because she got fired from her job and her boyfriend dumped her; she explains that when she met George she'd tried to be like Jane since she fell in love with him. Tess also encourages Jane to focus on her life and her own needs, rather than becoming a pushover for all of her friends by bending over backwards for their every desire.
Later at work, George tells Jane that he appreciates her because she never says no. Remembering that Kevin once said the same thing as a criticism, Jane quits and admits she only stayed at the job because she was in love with George. She discovers after an experimental kiss that she no longer loves him and goes to meet Kevin. She announces in front of a crowd at a wedding he is covering that she is in love with him.

Smokey and the Bandit Part 3,comedy,"As is the case with the two preceding Smokey and the Bandit films, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 begins with Big Enos and Little Enos offering a sizable wager on one's ability to transport a shipment a large distance in a short period of time. Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice, betting $250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.
Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroys their milk truck, which drenches them and disables their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus ""Snowman"" Snow as his replacement. Enthusiastic at the opportunity to portray the Bandit, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.
He later picks up Dusty Trails, who quits her job as a ""bookkeeper"" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial. Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his $250,000. Buford then begins a hot pursuit of Cledus, with another local officer who attempts to take charge of the situation. Not long after the local officer is disabled, Buford becomes disabled as well when sand is dumped on his squad car.
The pursuit quickly resumes as Buford catches up to the duo after Cledus and Dusty stop at a redneck bar to pick up some food. The chase resumes as they enter a local town, where mass chaos comes with their entry. Cledus escapes when an 18-wheeler blocks the alleyway Cledus ran through. While trying to get the truck out, Buford's car is hitched to a tow-truck. After unsuccessfully pleading with the traffic officer to release his car, he sends Junior out to unhook it. Unable to wait, he angrily reverses the car and escapes. The tow truck operator chases him in pursuit, with Junior dangling on the hook, spinning freely. Eventually, Buford manages to make the truck flip over, sending the truck and Junior flying. A number of cars continue to crash into the pile-up. The next scene comes sudden as the Bandit and Justice are in the Mississippi fairgrounds during the Joie Chitwood Thrill Show. Buford continues to pursue on two wheels after driving on an incline with Cledus letting the fame get to his head.
Cledus and Dusty decide to stop at a hotel for the night, where there are people who are involved in ""sexual"" acts, several of which are quite deviant. Buford finds the Bandit's Trans Am and decides to make a search of the building to find the fish, which he eventually does. While searching in the steamroom, Buford handcuffs himself to a muscular nymphomaniac woman who develops an immediate attraction for Sheriff Justice, and will not take no for an answer.
The next final scenes show Buford getting his tires blown by the ""Enos Devil Darts."" Cledus quickly arrives and retakes the fish. Cledus and Justice then start a final pursuit with Buford on two tires, first through a bunch of cattle, then to boats, then finally through a field where the Enoses set off a series of explosives, one of which destroys all of the bodywork, leaving the engine, seats, and police light bar (being held by Junior above his head.) Cledus decides to surrender the fish to let Buford win. Just after cashing in on the $250,000, Buford finds Cledus and begins to apprehend him, but Buford then imagines Cledus to be the ""Real"" Bandit, who sweet talks him to letting him go and starting a new pursuit. Similar to the ending of the 1977 movie, Buford is again chasing the Bandit in the hulk of his police cruiser (the muscular woman has taken Junior's place riding shotgun this time), while Junior chases after him, shouting ""Daddy, don't leave me"" for miles on end, dropping the reward money in the process.",comedy case precede smokey bandit film smokey bandit begin big eno little eno offer sizable wager ability transport shipment large distance short period time offer slight twist offer time retire sheriff buford justice bet badge ability transport large stuff fish eatery florida texas unlike early film big little eno time active desire buford fail goal buford dodge trap especially destroy milk truck drench disable engine far actually attempt hire bandit distraction stop decide bandit egotistical hard manage hire cledus snowman snow replacement enthusiastic opportunity portray bandit cledus park peterbilt climb wheel black gold pontiac trans later pick dusty trail quit job bookkeeper car dealership attempt wreck boss business seedy car dealership badmouth middle broadcast live tv commercial cledus manage catch buford interstate lasso buford fish justice police cruiser buford need fish retrieve buford begin hot pursuit cledus local officer attempt charge situation long local officer disable buford disabled sand dump squad car pursuit quickly resume buford catch duo cledus dusty stop redneck bar pick food chase resume enter local town mass chaos come entry cledus escape wheeler block alleyway cledus run try truck buford car hitch tow truck unsuccessfully plead traffic officer release car send junior unhook unable wait angrily reverse car escape tow truck operator chase pursuit junior dangle hook spin freely eventually buford manage truck flip send truck junior fly number car continue crash pile scene come sudden bandit justice mississippi fairground joie chitwood thrill buford continue pursue wheel drive incline cledus let fame head cledus dusty decide stop hotel night people involve sexual act deviant buford find bandit tran decide search building find fish eventually search steamroom buford handcuff muscular nymphomaniac woman develop immediate attraction sheriff justice answer final scene buford get tire blow enos devil dart cledus quickly arrive retake fish cledus justice start final pursuit buford tire bunch cattle boat finally field enose set series explosive destroy bodywork leave engine seat police light bar hold junior head cledus decide surrender fish let buford win cash buford find cledus begin apprehend buford imagine cledus real bandit sweet talk let start new pursuit similar ending movie buford chase bandit hulk police cruiser muscular woman take junior place ride shotgun time junior chase shout daddy leave mile end drop reward money process
All Night Long,comedy,"George Dupler (Gene Hackman), a married man nearing middle age, is demoted after a temper tantrum at work (throwing a chair out of his boss's window) and reduced to working as the midnight-shift manager of an all-night pharmacy/convenience store.
George's adult son, Freddie (Dennis Quaid), is having an affair with an older, married woman, who also happens to be Freddie's fourth cousin. George advises Freddie to stop the affair before it leads to any trouble, but Freddie declares that he might love her. One night at the store, George finally meets the woman, Cheryl (Barbra Streisand), an untalented singer-songwriter married to a volatile firefighter, Bobby (Kevin Dobson), and she begins to show an interest in him. After a while, the interest is mutual.
George goes to Cheryl's house to return her cigarette lighter. She offers to show George the paint job Freddie has done in her bedroom. George and Cheryl are about to get intimate, when Freddie comes over to see Cheryl for another tryst. George escapes before Freddie could see him, but Cheryl decides to tell Freddie about the affair she is having with his dad. The next day, when George is trying to sleep, and his wife, Helen (Diane Ladd), is having a French class, Freddie confronts his father, trying to fight him. Helen hears about the affair and George leaves. When she demands a divorce, George agrees.
George ends up quitting his job and buying a loft where he can pursue his dream of being an inventor. George goes to an anniversary party where everybody he knows is there, including his family, plus Cheryl and Bobby. He realizes Bobby is aware of the affair with his wife. George takes Cheryl away from the party and her husband. Even though Cheryl loves him, she thinks he is too good for her.
Cheryl goes to the fire station where Bobby works to talk to him. Bobby ends up yelling at her and is about to hit her when the fire alarm goes off. He and all of the firemen leave, whereupon we see that it was George who reported the nonexistent fire.

They Made Me a Fugitive,film noir,"Clem Morgan, demobilised from the Royal Air Force and unemployed after the war, is drawn into the world of crime. His psychopathic crime boss Narcy (short for Narcissus) deals in the black market, transporting goods in coffins to his headquarters in a funeral parlour. Clem finds the activity harmless enough, until one day he finds drugs in the latest coffin. Clem objects and tells his girlfriend, Ellie, that he will quit after one last job that night, the looting of a warehouse. Narcy betrays him, triggering the burglar alarm while he is inside. Clem manages to get back in the car with Narcy and another member of the gang, Soapy, before they drive off. When Narcy orders Soapy to run down a policeman, Clem grabs the wheel in an unsuccessful attempt to save the man's life and the car crashes into a lamppost. Narcy knocks him unconscious and has him moved to the driver's seat before fleeing with Soapy. Inspector Rockliffe arrives on the scene with other police officers to find the police officer dead and Clem injured in the car.
Clem is convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to fifteen years in prison in Dartmooor. Sally Connor, Narcy's girlfriend, visits him in prison, telling him that Narcy is now with Ellie (who has not visited Morgan in prison) and that she knows he was framed as she was told so by Cora, Soapy's girlfriend. Sally offers to try and persuade Soapy to give evidence but Clem tells her to go away.
Back in London, Sally tells Cora that she has seen Clem and wants to go and speak to Soapy to get him to tell the police what really happened, but Narcy has found out that Sally has gone to see Clem in prison and brutally beats her up.
Clem escapes from prison and the police start a manhunt for him. He seeks shelter in a remote farmhouse, where Mrs. Fenshaw lets him bathe, shave and change his clothes, and also cooks him some food. Mr. Fenshaw comes into the room, but turns out to be a hopeless drunk who is hardly aware of his surroundings. Mrs.Fenshaw then tries to get Clem to shoot her husband, stating that as he is already a murderer it won't make any difference to him. Clem refuses and leaves, but he has handled the gun, leaving his fingerprints on it, and Mrs. Fenshaw uses it to shoot her husband dead.
Clem is now wanted for the murder of Mr. Fenshaw as well, but maks his way back to London and goes to stay with Sally; he then manages to escape both the police and Narcy, but Sally is kidnapped by Narcy and his gang and taken to their hideout, where Cora is already being held. Cora is forced to tell Narcy where Soapy is hiding out (in a room in a rundown hotel nearby) and Narcy sends Jim to go and kill Soapy, which he does.
Clem, whilst trying to find Cora and Soapy, is caught by Rockliffe, who tells him that he is not convinced by Mrs. Fenshaw's story, the first indication that the police might believe in Clem's innocence. In order to use him as bait, Rockliffe lets Clem go, and he goes to the Valhalla funeral parlour to meet with Narcy's gang. After knocking other members of the gang out, Clem and Narcy end up fighting on the roof of the parlour, before Narcy falls to the ground. Rockliffe, Sally and Clem gather round, begging Narcy, who is dying, to tell the truth about who killed the policeman but Narcy sticks to his story and repeats that it was Clem, before dying. Rockliffe leads Clem away, whilst Sally promises to wait for him. The ending is rather ambiguous, as Clem presumably has to return to prison, and he is also facing a possible murder charge; all that Rockliffe can do is promise to look at any new evidence that comes up.",film noir clem morgan demobilise royal air force unemployed war draw world crime psychopathic crime boss narcy short narcissus deal black market transport good coffin headquarters funeral parlour clem find activity harmless day find drug late coffin clem object tell girlfriend ellie quit job night looting warehouse narcy betray trigger burglar alarm inside clem manage car narcy member gang soapy drive narcy order soapy run policeman clem grabs wheel unsuccessful attempt save man life car crash lamppost narcy knock unconscious move driver seat flee soapy inspector rockliffe arrive scene police officer find police officer dead clem injure car clem convict manslaughter sentence year prison dartmooor sally connor narcy girlfriend visit prison tell narcy ellie visit morgan prison know frame tell cora soapy girlfriend sally offer try persuade soapy evidence clem tell away london sally tell cora see clem want speak soapy tell police happen narcy find sally go clem prison brutally beat clem escape prison police start manhunt seek shelter remote farmhouse mrs fenshaw let bathe shave change clothe cook food mr fenshaw come room turn hopeless drunk hardly aware surrounding try clem shoot husband state murderer will difference clem refuse leave handle gun leave fingerprint mrs fenshaw use shoot husband dead clem want murder mr fenshaw mak way london go stay sally manage escape police narcy sally kidnap narcy gang take hideout cora hold cora force tell narcy soapy hide room rundown hotel nearby narcy send jim kill soapy clem whilst try find cora soapy catch rockliffe tell convince mrs fenshaw story indication police believe clem innocence order use bait rockliffe let clem go valhalla funeral parlour meet narcy gang knock member gang clem narcy end fight roof parlour narcy fall ground rockliffe sally clem gather round beg narcy die tell truth kill policeman narcy stick story repeat clem die rockliffe lead clem away whilst sally promise wait ending ambiguous clem presumably return prison face possible murder charge rockliffe promise look new evidence come
Feed the Kitty,animated short,"This cartoon is the first of a short series directed by Jones and using the characters of Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot (Marc Anthony's barks and grunts courtesy of an uncredited Mel Blanc).
Marc Anthony, a massive-chested bulldog, tries to intimidate a cute little stray kitten with his ferocious barking and grimacing. Not only is the kitten not frightened, she climbs right up on the dog's back and prepares to nestle herself in his fur. Despite wincing at her kneading, Marc instantly falls for the sleeping kitten and decides to adopt her, bringing her home with him.
Upon his arrival, his human owner (voiced by Bea Benaderet), tired of picking up his things, orders him not to bring one more thing inside the house. As she reprimands him, Marc Anthony discreetly hides the kitten under a bowl. Much of the cartoon centers on the kitten keeping several steps ahead of the dog, continually getting into things around the house and coming very close to alerting Marc Anthony's owner of her presence, with the dog employing numerous tactics to hide or disguise her as common household items. As the woman becomes increasingly confused by her dog's suddenly odd behavior, the kitten continues to play.
After a while, Marc Anthony takes the kitten into the kitchen and attempts to scold her, but when he hears his owner walking toward the kitchen, he hastily hides the kitten in a flour canister and tries to look innocent. Growing tired of his antics, his owner evicts him from the kitchen and tells him to stay out while she bakes cookies. Marc Anthony watches as his owner scoops out a cup of flour, and is horrified to see that the kitten is in the measuring cup. The lady pours the flour, along with the kitten, into a mixing bowl and prepares to use an electric mixer. The dog tries several times to thwart her, finally spraying his face with whipped cream to make himself appear rabid, resulting in his disbelieving and exasperated owner throwing him out of the house. Meanwhile, the kitten climbs out of the bowl and hides behind a box of soap flakes to clean herself up.
Marc Anthony, unaware that the kitten has escaped, can only watch in horror as his owner mixes the cookie batter, rolls out the dough, cuts it into shapes and places the cookies in the oven. At each phase of the process, the poor dog becomes increasingly distressed until he finally collapses in tears, literally crying a puddle in the back yard. His mistress comes out a short time later and, thinking he is crying over being disciplined, lets him back inside and tells him he has been punished enough. She attempts to console him by giving him a cookie in the shape of a cat. Stunned, Marc Anthony takes the cookie and places it on his back where the kitten had slept earlier, and breaks down in tears once again.
The kitten then walks up and meows at him. Marc Anthony, immediately overjoyed to see his friend safe and sound, picks the kitten up and kisses her, then suddenly realizes that his owner is watching. He vainly tries to disguise the kitten like he did earlier, but the lady simply stands in front of him tapping her foot, with her hands on her hips. He finally begs at his mistress's feet and, to his surprise, she allows him to keep the kitten, sternly telling him that the kitten is completely his responsibility. At this realization, the dog appears to reconsider for a moment, but that soon passes when the kitten purrs at him, climbs onto his back again, kneads his fur and curls up to sleep. Marc Anthony smiles contentedly and tucks her in.",animate short cartoon short series direct jones character marc anthony pussyfoot marc anthony bark grunt courtesy uncredited mel blanc marc anthony massive cheste bulldog try intimidate cute little stray kitten ferocious barking grimacing kitten frightened climb right dog prepare nestle fur despite wince kneading marc instantly fall sleep kitten decide adopt bring home arrival human owner voice bea benaderet tired pick thing order bring thing inside house reprimand marc anthony discreetly hide kitten bowl cartoon center kitten keep step ahead dog continually get thing house come close alert marc anthony owner presence dog employ numerous tactic hide disguise common household item woman increasingly confused dog suddenly odd behavior kitten continue play marc anthony take kitten kitchen attempt scold hear owner walk kitchen hastily hide kitten flour canister try look innocent grow tired antic owner evict kitchen tell stay bake cookie marc anthony watch owner scoop cup flour horrify kitten measure cup lady pour flour kitten mix bowl prepare use electric mixer dog try time thwart finally spray face whip cream appear rabid result disbelieve exasperated owner throw house kitten climb bowl hide box soap flake clean marc anthony unaware kitten escape watch horror owner mix cookie batter roll dough cut shape place cookie oven phase process poor dog increasingly distressed finally collapse tear literally cry puddle yard mistress come short time later think cry discipline let inside tell punish attempt console give cookie shape cat stun marc anthony take cookie place kitten sleep early break tear kitten walk meow marc anthony immediately overjoy friend safe sound pick kitten kiss suddenly realize owner watch vainly try disguise kitten like early lady simply stand tap foot hand hip finally beg mistress foot surprise allow kitten sternly tell kitten completely responsibility realization dog appear reconsider moment soon pass kitten purr climb knead fur curl sleep marc anthony smile contentedly tuck

Donald in Mathmagic Land,animation,"Donald Duck, holding a hunting rifle, passes through a doorway to find that he has entered Mathmagic Land. This ""mighty strange"" fantasy land contains trees with square roots, a stream flowing with numbers, and a walking pencil that plays tic-tac-toe. A geometric bird recites (almost perfectly) the first 15 digits of pi. Donald soon hears the voice of the unseen ""True Spirit of Adventure"" (Paul Frees), who will guide him on his journey through ""the wonderland of mathematics"".
Donald is initially not interested in exploring Mathmagic Land, believing that math is just for ""eggheads"". When ""Mr. Spirit"" suggests a connection between math and music, though, Donald is intrigued. First, Donald discovers the relationships between octaves and string length which develop the musical scale of today. Next, Donald finds himself in ancient Greece, where Pythagoras and his contemporaries are discovering these same relationships. Pythagoras (on the harp), a flute player, and a double bass player hold a ""jam session"" which Donald joins after a few moments using a vase as a bongo drum. Pythagoras' music is, as the Spirit explains, the basis of today's music, and that music would not exist without ""eggheads"". The segment ends with a sequence of live action musicians playing both jazz and classical music and Pythagoras' pals fading away.
After shaking hands with Pythagoras, who then vanishes, Donald finds on his hand a pentagram, the symbol of the secret Pythagorean society. The Spirit then shows Donald how the mysterious golden section appears in the pentagram. Next, the pentagram is shown to contain the pattern for constructing golden rectangles many times over. According to the Spirit, the golden rectangle has influenced both ancient and modern cultures in many ways.
Donald learns how the golden rectangle appears in many ancient buildings, such as the Parthenon and the Notre Dame cathedral. Paintings such as the Mona Lisa and various sculptures such as the Venus de Milo contain several golden rectangles. The use of the golden rectangle is found in modern architecture, such as the United Nations building in New York City. Modern painters have also rediscovered the magic of the golden rectangles.
The Spirit shows Donald how the golden rectangle and pentagram are related to the human body and nature, respectively. The human body contains the ""ideal proportions"" of the golden section; Donald, overinterpreting the Spirit's advice, tries to make his own body fit such a proportion, but his efforts are to no avail; he ends up ""all pent up in a pentagon"". The pentagram and pentagon are then shown to be found in many flowers and animals, such as the petunia, the star jasmine, the starfish, the waxflower, and with the help of the inside of a nautilus shell, the Spirit explains that the magic proportions of the golden section are often found in the spirals of nature's designs, quoting Pythagoras: ""Everything is arranged according to number and mathematical shape"".
Donald learns that mathematics applies not only to nature, architecture, and music, but also to games that are played on geometrical surfaces, including chess, baseball, football, basketball, hopscotch, and three-cushion billiards. Donald even volunteers the game Tiddlywinks, but the Spirit does not pursue this option. Themes of Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass are scattered throughout the chess scene; Carroll himself was both a writer and a mathematician. The extended billiards scene, which features a non-speaking live actor, shows the calculations involved in the game's ""diamond system"", and Donald finally learns how to do the calculations, spectacularly hitting ten cushions in a single shot.
The Spirit then asks Donald to play a mental game, but he finds Donald's mind to be too cluttered with ""Antiquated Ideas"", ""Bungling"", ""False Concepts"", ""Superstitions"", and ""Confusion"". After some mental house-cleaning, Donald plays with a circle and a triangle in his mind, he spins them to make them respectively into a sphere and a cone, and then he discovers useful inventions such as the wheel, train, magnifying glass, drill, spring, propeller, and telescope.
Donald discovers that pentagrams can be drawn inside each other indefinitely. Therefore, numbers provide an avenue to consider the infinite. The Spirit states that scientific knowledge and technological advances are unlimited, and the key to unlocking the doors of the future is mathematics. By the end of the film, Donald understands and appreciates the value of mathematics. The film closes with a quote from Galileo: ""Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the universe"".",animation donald duck hold hunting rifle pass doorway find enter mathmagic land mighty strange fantasy land contain tree square root stream flow number walk pencil play tic tac toe geometric bird recite perfectly digit pi donald soon hear voice unseen true spirit adventure paul free guide journey wonderland mathematics donald initially interested explore mathmagic land believe math egghead mr spirit suggest connection math music donald intrigue donald discover relationship octave string length develop musical scale today donald find ancient greece pythagora contemporary discover relationship pythagora harp flute player double bass player hold jam session donald join moment vase bongo drum pythagoras music spirit explain basis today music music exist egghead segment end sequence live action musician play jazz classical music pythagora pal fade away shake hand pythagora vanish donald find hand pentagram symbol secret pythagorean society spirit show donald mysterious golden section appear pentagram pentagram show contain pattern construct golden rectangle time accord spirit golden rectangle influence ancient modern culture way donald learn golden rectangle appear ancient building parthenon notre dame cathedral painting mona lisa sculpture venus de milo contain golden rectangle use golden rectangle find modern architecture united nations building new york city modern painter rediscover magic golden rectangle spirit show donald golden rectangle pentagram relate human body nature respectively human body contain ideal proportion golden section donald overinterprete spirit advice try body fit proportion effort avail end pen pentagon pentagram pentagon show find flower animal petunia star jasmine starfish waxflower help inside nautilus shell spirit explain magic proportion golden section find spiral nature design quote pythagora arrange accord number mathematical shape donald learn mathematic apply nature architecture music game play geometrical surface include chess baseball football basketball hopscotch cushion billiard donald volunteer game tiddlywink spirit pursue option theme lewis carroll look glass scatter chess scene carroll writer mathematician extended billiard scene feature non speak live actor show calculation involve game diamond system donald finally learn calculation spectacularly hit cushion single shot spirit ask donald play mental game find donald mind cluttered antiquated idea bungle false concept superstition confusion mental house cleaning donald play circle triangle mind spin respectively sphere cone discover useful invention wheel train magnifying glass drill spring propeller telescope donald discover pentagram draw inside indefinitely number provide avenue consider infinite spirit state scientific knowledge technological advance unlimited key unlock door future mathematic end film donald understand appreciate value mathematic film close quote galileo mathematics alphabet god write universe

Trilogy of Terror II,horror,"A wealthy man by the name of Ansford (Matt Clark) discovers his young wife Laura (Lysette Anthony) having an affair with her cousin. Having video proof he threatens Laura to be faithful and honest or he will turn the video over to the news stations and cut her out of his multimillion-dollar will. Meanwhile, her lover Ben (Geraint Wyn Davies) comes up with the idea to murder Ansford and collect all his money. After Ansford is pushed down the stairs and killed, Laura and Ben are more than happy to collect their winnings, however all does not go as planned. Before dying, Ansford transferred all of his millions into an account in Zürich, and microfilmed the access codes, which were buried with him. Now, Laura and Ben have to dig up his grave, and Ben climbs into the opened coffin to retrieve the microfilm. Soon after, Laura shoots and kills Ben to claim all the money for herself. All of a sudden, the body of the dead millionaire is dragged through a hole in the side of the coffin by flesh-eating giant rats with red eyes, and Laura is forced to crawl in after him through a network of underground graveyard tunnels. Eventually the advancing rats corner her into another buried coffin. Laura tries to keep the rats away by firing her gun at them but quickly the rats pour into the coffin and devour her.
This first film is based on Henry Kuttner's eponymous short story, albeit considerably altered. In Kuttner’s tale, the thief is a male cemetery caretaker intent on exterminating a colony of abnormally large rats.
It has been some time since Bobby ""accidentally"" drowned, leaving his mother Alma (Lysette Anthony) depressed and guilty. However, while her husband is away on business, she determines to raise her son from the dead. Armed with a magic book and a ""Key of Solomon"" (in this case, a talisman rather than a book), she conjures dark forces to bring her son back. Before going to bed, a vicious thunderstorm approaches the luxurious beach mansion. Hearing a knock, she opens the door to discover her son. After cleaning him up, she begins to make him feel at home again. However, all does not work out when Bobby goes completely mad and begins to terrorize his mother in the dark house with a sledgehammer and a butcher knife. The mother soon realizes that it is not Bobby who returned to her, but a demon that had taken his place, as he says ""Bobby hates you, Mommy, so he sent me instead,"" revealing his demon-like face and the screen blacks out.
This segment, about the Zuni fetish doll ""He Who Kills"", is a sequel to the third segment of the original Trilogy of Terror, ""Amelia"".
After finding the double homicide of Amelia and her mother from the first movie with the Zuni Doll at the scene, the local police drop off the doll to local Dr. Simpson (Lysette Anthony). As she begins to examine the doll she learns that the doll comes to life when a gold chain is removed from his neck and that the Zuni Doll has a desire for flesh. It also seems to regenerate (the idea itself initially laughable to both Dr. Simpson and her assistant) as when she chips away the charred wood, the Zuni Doll seems to be brand new.
After a quick pizza break, she discovers the doll missing. One of the officers investigates the surrounding museum, only to be shot down by an arrow from one of the exhibits, courtesy of the doll. After minutes of looking, she finds the doll attacking and running towards her with a lab knife as a weapon. Now Dr. Simpson is all alone in a large museum with a tiny killer on the loose. Much like the first movie, Dr. Simpson catches the Zuni Doll in a briefcase, giving her time to try to reach her keys. As the doll cuts through the case, Dr. Simpson tries twice to grab the knife, only to get cut as in the first film. The doll eventually breaks through, meeting the stabbing force of a screwdriver-like object from Dr. Simpson. Making the same mistake as the first movie's protagonist, Dr. Simpson opens the briefcase to be bitten ferociously by the Zuni Doll. She eventually regains control, and tosses the doll into a large rectangular container of sulfuric acid. As the Zuni Doll comes to a halt in its motion, Dr. Simpson goes to grab tongs in an attempt to remove the doll, only to be possessed by He Who Kills, the spirit inhabiting the doll. Later on she kills her date with the same axe she tried to use against the Zuni Doll.",horror wealthy man ansford matt clark discover young wife laura lysette anthony have affair cousin have video proof threaten laura faithful honest turn video news station cut multimillion dollar lover ben geraint wyn davy come idea murder ansford collect money ansford push stair kill laura ben happy collect winning plan die ansford transfer million account zürich microfilm access code bury laura ben dig grave ben climb open coffin retrieve microfilm soon laura shoot kill ben claim money sudden body dead millionaire drag hole coffin flesh eat giant rat red eye laura force crawl network underground graveyard tunnel eventually advance rat corner bury coffin laura try rat away fire gun quickly rat pour coffin devour film base henry kuttner eponymous short story albeit considerably alter kuttner tale thief male cemetery caretaker intent exterminate colony abnormally large rat time bobby accidentally drown leave mother alma lysette anthony depressed guilty husband away business determine raise son dead arm magic book key solomon case talisman book conjure dark force bring son go bed vicious thunderstorm approach luxurious beach mansion hear knock open door discover son clean begin feel home work bobby go completely mad begin terrorize mother dark house sledgehammer butcher knife mother soon realize bobby return demon take place say bobby hate mommy send instead reveal demon like face screen black segment zuni fetish doll kill sequel segment original trilogy terror amelia find double homicide amelia mother movie zuni doll scene local police drop doll local dr simpson lysette anthony begin examine doll learn doll come life gold chain remove neck zuni doll desire flesh regenerate idea initially laughable dr simpson assistant chip away charred wood zuni doll brand new quick pizza break discover doll miss officer investigate surround museum shoot arrow exhibit courtesy doll minute look find doll attack run lab knife weapon dr simpson large museum tiny killer loose like movie dr simpson catch zuni doll briefcase give time try reach key doll cut case dr simpson try twice grab knife cut film doll eventually break meet stabbing force screwdriver like object dr simpson make mistake movie protagonist dr simpson open briefcase bite ferociously zuni doll eventually regain control toss doll large rectangular container sulfuric acid zuni doll come halt motion dr simpson go grab tong attempt remove doll possess kill spirit inhabit doll later kill date axe try use zuni doll

Kabali,action drama,"A Kuala Lumpur–based don Kabaleeswaran alias Kabali (Rajinikanth) is released after spending 25 years in prison on a false charge of starting a massacre at a local Hindu temple that killed many, including his wife Kumudhavalli alias Kumudha (Radhika Apte). He immediately resumes charge of his old gang and soon confronts Loganathan alias Loga (Mime Gopi), a drug smuggler. Loga insults Kumudha, saying that she would have been sold into prostitution had she been alive. In retaliation, Kabali rams his car into Loga, killing him; however, the incident makes him believe that his wife may be still alive. Later, Kabali survives an assassination attempt by Tamizh Kumaran alias Kumaran (Kalaiyarasan), whose father Tamilmaaran (Charles Vinoth) was killed by Kabali when Kumaran was a young boy. The next day, at a function organised by the Free Life Foundation School, a school started by Kabali's friend Ameer (John Vijay) to reform youngsters involved in criminal activities, Kabali talks about his past.
Kabali was the protege of Tamilmaaran's father Tamilnesan (Nassar), a don who fought for the rights of the Tamil Malaysians. Tamilnesan was killed by Veerasekaran alias Veera (Kishore), who was also a part of Tamilnesan's gang, but disliked his rules such as not involving in illegal activities like drug smuggling and prostitution. Following Tamilnesan's death, Kabali took charge of Tamilnesan's gang. But Veera manipulated Tamilmaaran by telling him that he, being Tamilnesan's son, should lead the gang and not Kabali. Tamilmaaran invited Kabali and a pregnant Kumudha for a temple function. However, this was revealed to be a trap as Veera and his men confronted Kabali and Kumudha at the function. In the ensuing scuffle, Kabali was brutally attacked while Kumudha was shot and seemingly killed. Kabali then killed Tamilmaaran for his betrayal in front of a young Kumaran and was soon arrested on a false charge of instigating the massacre.
Kumaran, after hearing Kabali's speech, realises his mistake and apologises to him. He tells him that Velu (R. Amarendran), one of Veera's henchmen who was present at the temple massacre, is aware of what happened to Kumudha. Kabali then leaves for Thailand, where Velu is residing. On confronting Velu, he learns that his daughter is still alive. At this juncture, Kabali is confronted by Yogi (Dhansika), a contract killer hired by Veera and his boss Tony Lee alias Tony (Winston Chao), who heads the rival Gang 43 in Kuala Lumpur, to eliminate Kabali. But Yogi instead kills the men who had come with her and reveals herself to Kabali as his daughter, who had been raised by Velu. She also tells him that Kumudha is still alive and is living with a French family in Puducherry. Kabali and Yogi then leave for Puducherry, where, after several days of searching, they reunite with Kumudha and spend a few days with her there. While in Puducherry, Kabali and his family are attacked by men sent by Tony. However, Kabali and Yogi fight them off and escape safely with Kumudha.
Kabali and his family soon return to Kuala Lumpur, where he is told that Ameer has been severely injured in a car accident set up by Tony; his henchman Jeeva (Dinesh) was brutally chopped to pieces by Tony after refusing to join the Gang 43; and the Gang 43 had destroyed the Free Life Foundation School and started to control the Kuala Lumpur underworld, eliminating any gang who dared to oppose them. On hearing all this, Kabali decides to finish Veera and Tony once and for all. He and his family attend the 100th birthday party for a respected Malaysian don Ang Lee, who had invited all gangs, including the Gang 43. At the party, Kabali starts a shootout with the help of Kumaran, which ends with him killing Veera and Tony.
Some months later, Kabali, Kumudha, Kumaran and Yogi attend a function organised by the Free Life Foundation. One of the Free Life alumni, a youngster name Tiger (Hari Krishnan), who is known to be aggressive and reckless, walks up to Kabali, with scenes showing him speaking to the police prior to the function.

The Young Lions,war drama,"German ski instructor Christian Diestl (Marlon Brando) is hopeful that Adolf Hitler will bring new prosperity to Germany, so when war breaks out he joins the army as a lieutenant. Dissatisfied with police duty in Paris, he requests to be transferred and is assigned to the front in North Africa. He sees what the war has done to his captain (Maximilian Schell) and the captain's wife (May Britt), and he is sickened by their behavior.
Michael Whiteacre (Dean Martin) and Noah Ackerman (Montgomery Clift) befriend each other during their U.S. Army draft physical examination, and attend basic training together. They are then stationed in London. Michael is in show business and romantically involved with socialite Margaret Freemantle (Barbara Rush) who, coincidentally, in 1938 dated Christian in the Bavarian Alps where she spent her skiing vacation. She was upset by his Nazi beliefs and deserted him on New Year's Eve to return to Michael.
Noah, who is Jewish and employed as a junior department store clerk, attends a party Michael throws, where he meets Hope Plowman (Hope Lange). She falls in love with him, and introduces her fiancé to her provincial father, who doesn't like Jews, but has never met one. After a chat with Noah, the father approves of the marriage.
In the service, a commanding officer and some of the tough guys in his company try to bully Noah and demonstrate their bigotry. Noah gains the respect of the enlisted men by standing up to them in a series of fist fights, even though he's much smaller and often badly hurt. However, authorities discover Noah's deprived situation, and court-martial his officer.
Each of these soldiers comes to view the war differently. Christian is conflicted, hating what the war has done to his fellow Germans, but unable to escape from his role in it. He despises what his fellow soldiers have done in the name of the Fatherland, but is determined to fulfill his duty to the end. While visiting his seriously wounded captain in a hospital, he unwittingly brings him a sharp weapon, and later learns from the captain's attractive and seductive wife that he had committed suicide there.
Michael spends most of the war on a safe easy job, nowhere near any real fighting, thanks to his Broadway fame. He finally decides to join the fighting after Margaret shames him into it. By pulling strings, he rejoins his old outfit on the front in the war's final days, a bit too late to matter.
Noah simply does his duty to the best of his ability, hoping to live through the horrors of war and get home safely to his wife and their new baby. He has a heroic moment where he risks his own life by swimming across a river to save a frightened fellow soldier, one who was especially prejudiced against him in boot camp. Meanwhile, Christian discovers the reality of the Nazi regime when he stumbles upon a concentration camp filled with Jews, and hearing the commander tell of the exterminations. Shortly afterwards, the camp is liberated by American forces, including Michael and Noah. The mayor (John Banner) of a nearby town offers working parties of his constituents, anticipating media attention. However, he is rudely rebuffed by Whiteacre and Ackerman's company commander, Captain Green (Arthur Franz), when an imprisoned rabbi asks Green for permission to hold a religious service, and the mayor protests.
Seeing how Ackerman is affected by the camp, Green instructs him to take a walk and sends Whiteacre with him. Shocked and disgusted, the two GIs wander away from the camp. Nearby, dazed, tired, and hungry Christian hides with his weapon, but then screams in rage, breaking his MP 40 apart. The noise draws Michael and Noah, and upon seeing the German, Michael shoots Christian. The two Americans silently watch Christian die, and then quietly walk back towards camp.
The final scene shows Ackerman emerging from the same subway station through which he left home to the war. As Hope notices him, she lifts up their daughter for him to see, and he then ascends the stairs to his family.",war drama german ski instructor christian diestl marlon brando hopeful adolf hitler bring new prosperity germany war break join army lieutenant dissatisfied police duty paris request transfer assign north africa see war captain maximilian schell captain wife britt sicken behavior michael whiteacre dean martin noah ackerman montgomery clift befriend army draft physical examination attend basic training station london michael business romantically involve socialite margaret freemantle barbara rush coincidentally date christian bavarian alp spend skiing vacation upset nazi belief desert new year eve return michael noah jewish employ junior department store clerk attend party michael throw meet hope plowman hope lange fall love introduce fiancé provincial father like jews meet chat noah father approve marriage service command officer tough guy company try bully noah demonstrate bigotry noah gain respect enlisted man stand series fist fight small badly hurt authority discover noah deprived situation court martial officer soldier come view war differently christian conflict hate war fellow german unable escape role despise fellow soldier fatherland determined fulfill duty end visit seriously wound captain hospital unwittingly bring sharp weapon later learn captain attractive seductive wife commit suicide michael spend war safe easy job near real fighting thank broadway fame finally decide join fighting margaret shame pull string rejoin old outfit war final day bit late matter noah simply duty good ability hope live horror war home safely wife new baby heroic moment risk life swim river save frightened fellow soldier especially prejudiced boot camp christian discover reality nazi regime stumble concentration camp fill jews hear commander tell extermination shortly camp liberate american force include michael noah mayor john banner nearby town offer work party constituent anticipate medium attention rudely rebuff whiteacre ackerman company commander captain green arthur franz imprison rabbi ask green permission hold religious service mayor protest see ackerman affect camp green instruct walk send whiteacre shocked disgusted gis wander away camp nearby daze tired hungry christian hide weapon scream rage break mp apart noise draw michael noah see german michael shoot christian americans silently watch christian die quietly walk camp final scene show ackerman emerge subway station leave home war hope notice lift daughter ascend stair family
Stir of Echoes,horror,"Tom Witzky is a phone lineman living in a working-class neighborhood in Chicago with his pregnant wife Maggie and his son Jake, who possesses the ability to commune with the dead. At a party one evening, Tom challenges Lisa, Maggie's sister who is a believer in paranormal activity, to hypnotize him. After putting him under, Lisa plants a post-hypnotic suggestion in Tom urging him to ""be more open-minded"". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior.
While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the 'L' station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an eighth-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions.
Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. During an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; here a policeman named Neil immediately recognizes Jake's unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of like-minded people to learn more about what is happening to his son. Maggie withholds her conversation with Neil from Tom and goes to the meeting herself, and Neil tells her the spirit that contacted Tom has asked for something and will grow upset if it does not get done. As predicted, Samantha begins plaguing Tom, eventually leading to his insomnia. He goes back to Lisa and demands she undo what she did, but when she hypnotizes him, Samantha tells him to dig. Tom complies and digs holes in the backyard and eventually tears up the house in a desperate attempt to appease Samantha.
While Maggie and Jake attend her grandmother's wake at a relative's house, Tom inadvertently knocks down a shoddy brick wall in the basement and discovers Samantha's decomposed remains. He receives a vision showing him that before his family moved in, Adam and Kurt lured Samantha into the house to rape her. When she resisted, they unintentionally suffocated her and hid her body. Tom brings Frank back to the basement to disclose to him the crime. Frank breaks down and admits that Adam and Kurt had already confided their secret to him and Harry. Frank pulls out a gun and demands to be alone. As Tom leaves the basement, he hears a single shot.
Harry and Kurt suddenly show up. Harry, in his capacity as landlord, voices displeasure with the torn up house. They corner Tom with the intention of killing him, but Maggie interrupts them when she arrives back home. As Harry takes her hostage, Frank emerges from the basement and fatally shoots both Kurt and Harry to save Tom and Maggie. Tom notices Samantha's spirit put on her glasses and coat, smile as she walks down the road, and disappear. Afterwards, the family packs up a U-Haul and moves out of the house. Meanwhile, Samantha's mother and sister are finally able to give her a proper funeral and burial. Tom and Maggie smile happily as they drive away to a new neighborhood, but Jake covers his ears as they approach their new home, overwhelmed by the spirits that linger in all of the houses they pass by.",horror tom witzky phone lineman live working class neighborhood chicago pregnant wife maggie son jake possess ability commune dead party evening tom challenge lisa maggie sister believer paranormal activity hypnotize put lisa plant post hypnotic suggestion tom urge open minded tom begin experience vision violent scuffle involve girl later learn samantha kozac year old disappear neighborhood month prior tom maggie attend high school football game jake overhear babysitter debbie kozac speak samantha debbie get upset snatch jake run night tom sense jake danger rush home find go tom see strange flash red light eventually lead l station debbie speak mother jake tom maggie confront debbie angrily question sister samantha explain intellectual disability have mental capacity eighth year old child tendency trust stranger tom deny know debbie admit maggie girl vision tom obsess samantha begin probe member community disappearance attract attention landlord harry damon tom friend frank mccarthy respective son kurt damon adam mccarthy dismiss samantha runaway teen afternoon walk jake maggie encounter funeral chicago policeman salute ceremony policeman name neil immediately recognize jake unique talent invite tom private gathering like minded people learn happen son maggie withhold conversation neil tom go meeting neil tell spirit contact tom ask grow upset predict samantha begin plague tom eventually lead insomnia go lisa demand undo hypnotize samantha tell dig tom complie dig hole backyard eventually tear house desperate attempt appease samantha maggie jake attend grandmother wake relative house tom inadvertently knock shoddy brick wall basement discover samantha decomposed remain receive vision show family move adam kurt lure samantha house rape resist unintentionally suffocate hide body tom bring frank basement disclose crime frank break admit adam kurt confide secret harry frank pull gun demand tom leave basement hear single shot harry kurt suddenly harry capacity landlord voice displeasure tear house corner tom intention kill maggie interrupt arrive home harry take hostage frank emerge basement fatally shoot kurt harry save tom maggie tom notice samantha spirit glass coat smile walk road disappear family pack u haul move house samantha mother sister finally able proper funeral burial tom maggie smile happily drive away new neighborhood jake cover ear approach new home overwhelm spirit linger house pass

Gunday,action/romance,"The story begins with a narration of the independence of Bangladesh after the 1971 war. Amongst those affected by the partition are two orphans: Bikram Bose (Ranveer Singh) and Bala Bhattacharya (Arjun Kapoor). They meet Lateef (Pankaj Tripathi), who offers them food in exchange for smuggling guns. One of Lateef's customers, an army officer, wants one of the boys as his sex slave; if Lateef refuses, his daughter will be taken. Lateef chooses Bala at first, but Bikram insists that he will go instead. Bala refuses to leave his best friend, and returns to save Bikram from the officer, whom they kill. This makes them partners in crime; when the army chases them, Lateef is killed while trying to protect the duo. Bikram and Bala flee to Calcutta and work at a restaurant. After being mistreated and insulted, they learn that pilfering coal is a way to make easy money.
As adults, Bikram and Bala loot coal trains and sell the pilfered coal; their chief competitor is Dibakar (Deepraj Rana). When Bikram and Bala loot one of Dibakar's trains, his men threaten them. Undeterred, they promise to loot his next train as well. When they arrive to loot Dibakar's train, he calls them ""refugees"" and a fight ensues. Before they kill Dibakar, Bikram and Bala tell him that they are Indians, not refugees. Now having control of the coal business, they expand into other businesses by laundering money with Kaali Kaka's (Saurabh Shukla) help. They become local heroes by building hospitals, donating to charities and building schools. Although they provide jobs for the poor, their business dealings make them a target of the law. Assistant Commissioner of Police Satyajeet Sarkar (Irrfan Khan) is summoned to arrest Bikram and Bala. Sarkar, knowing that they can cover their tracks with Kaali Kaka, warns them that he will arrest them when he finds evidence against them.
A businessman invites Bikram and Bala to the opening of his new club in Calcutta. He introduces them to Himanshu (Anant Sharma), his assistant. They meet Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), a cabaret dancer. They both fall in love with her, and decide that whoever wins her heart will marry her. Nandita invites them to a theatre to tell them whom she loves. Bala gets into a fight there with a man who insults Nandita and shoots him. Bikram tells Bala to go into hiding, promising not to see Nandita until he returns. Sarkar warns Bikram that if Bala returns to Calcutta, he will be killed. Nandita tells Bikram that she loves him, but if they do not observe Durga Puja together she will never see him again. Bikram agrees to meet her. Later, Bala learns about this through Himanshu, and returns to Calcutta. Enraged when he sees Bikram and Nandita, Bala accuses Bikram of breaking his promise and shoots at him. He hits Nandita instead, who is rushed to hospital and survives.
Bala learns that their businesses are in Bikram's name, and demands his share. Bikram agrees, even sharing the ration card which is proof of their Indian nationality. Bala suggests sharing Nandita; angering Bikram, who fights Bala. Bikram wins but spares Bala as he saved his life. However, he warns Bala that if he bothers Nandita he will kill him. When Bikram proposes to Nandita, she says she cannot marry him unless he leaves his criminal life behind; Bikram agrees. A vengeful Bala blows up Bikram's coal mines and kidnaps Nandita. As Bikram prepares to kill Bala, Sarkar asks Bikram to turn the state's evidence against Bala so he and Nandita can marry. Bala tells Nandita that he will kill her unless she leaves Bikram; Nandita retorts that she loves Bikram. Heartbroken, Bala apologises to Nandita and returns her to Bikram. In reality, Nandita is an undercover police officer helping Sarkar arrest Bikram and Bala. When Bikram prepares to help Sarkar implicate Bala, he encounters the man Bala supposedly killed and learns that he is a police officer. Nandita tries to convince Bikram that he will be treated leniently by the law, he believes the law was responsible for destroying their childhood. Nandita reveals her identity to Bikram, and he realises that she was a trap Sarkar set to separate him from Bala. When she asks him to surrender, he refuses and rejoins Bala.
Himanshu brings Bala into the coal mine to meet Dutta. Himanshu tells him that he is Dibakar's brother, and saw him murdered by Bikram and Bala. He reveals Nandita's identity and tries to kill Bala, but Bikram rescues him and Bala impales Himanshu. While trying to escape, they are then cornered by Sarkar and Nandita, who again tells Bikram that she loves him and he should surrender; Sarkar also tries to convince Bala to surrender. Bikram and Bala see a passing train and run towards it. As Bikram and Bala are inches away from catching the train, Sarkar and Nandita shoot at them.

Dr. Cyclops,science fiction horror,"Biologists Dr. Mary Robinson (Janice Logan) and Dr. Bullfinch (Charles Halton) are summoned by Dr. Alexander Thorkel (Albert Dekker) to his remote laboratory in the Peruvian jungle. They are accompanied by mineralogist Dr. Bill Stockton (Thomas Coley), a friend of Mary's and a last minute substitute for another scientist, and Steve Baker (Victor Kilian), who wants to make sure his hired mules are well cared for (and suspects Thorkel may have discovered a rich mine). When they arrive, Thorkel asks the scientists to describe a specimen in his microscope, since his eyesight is too poor for him to do so himself. Bill identifies iron crystal contamination, much to Thorkel's satisfaction. Then, to their astonishment, Thorkel thanks them for their services and wants them to leave.
Insulted that they have traveled thousands of miles for nothing, they set up camp in Thorkel's stockade, insisting that he tell them more about his research. While snooping around, Steve discovers the area is rich with pitchblende, an ore of uranium and radium. When he finds them looking around his laboratory, Thorkel becomes angry, but as he is outnumbered, reveals he is shrinking living creatures, among them a horse, using radiation piped from a radium deposit down a deep shaft. He invites them and his assistant Pedro (Frank Yaconelli) to examine his apparatus, then locks them inside his radiation chamber. With the information that Bill has provided, he is able to correct the flaw that has killed his prior specimens. When his victims awaken, they find they have shrunk to twelve inches tall.
They flee from Thorkel, and then from Thorkel's cat Satanus, from whom they are saved by Pedro's dog Tipo, who is bewildered by his master now being smaller than him. Bullfinch is eventually coaxed into speaking with Thorkel, but the latter is not interested in negotiating, merely in measuring Bullfinch. When he discovers that Bullfinch is growing, he realizes that the effect is only temporary. He murders Bullfinch in cold blood and sets out to hunt the others down so that they cannot go to the authorities.
The four survivors hack their way through gigantic jungle foliage and do battle with the wildlife. They attempt to launch Pedro's small boat (now enormous in their eyes), but are attacked by a caiman. When Thorkel locates them using Pedro's dog, Pedro leads Thorkel away from the others and is shot dead. The fugitives hide in one of Thorkel’s specimen cases and are brought back undetected to his lab.
While Thorkel goes outside to adjust a machine, Bill, Steve and Mary prepare to kill him with his own shotgun when he lies down on his bed. However, he instead falls asleep at his desk. They hide his spare glasses, then Steve steals the pair Thorkel put on his desk, managing to smash one lens before Thorkel awakes. Thorkel chases the shrunken trio to the mineshaft and precariously hangs by a rope when the plank he was lying on breaks. Steve cuts the rope, causing Thorkel to plunge to his death.
Months later, Bill, Steve and Mary return to civilization, restored to their original size.

Jurassic World,adventure science fiction,"Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Isla Nublar, the site of the original Jurassic Park, where a new theme park named Jurassic World has operated for years. Simon Masrani, the park's owner, has encouraged geneticist Dr. Henry Wu to create a hybrid dinosaur to attract visitors. The two boys meet their aunt, Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant Zara to be their guide, but the boys evade her and explore the resort on their own.
Owen Grady, a Navy veteran, has been researching the intelligence of the park's four Velociraptors. InGen Security chief Vic Hoskins believes the raptors should be trained for military use despite objections from Owen and his assistant Barry. Masrani has Owen evaluate the enclosure of the park's new hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus rex, before the attraction opens. Owen warns Claire about the danger of raising Indominus in isolation, pointing out its lack of socialization with other animals. When they discover that the Indominus seems to have escaped, Owen and two others enter the enclosure. Able to camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, the Indominus suddenly appears and devours Owen's companions before escaping into the island's interior. Owen suggests that the Indominus must be killed, but Masrani instead sends a specialized unit equipped with non-lethal weaponry to capture it. After most of the unit is killed, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.
While exploring the park in a gyrosphere ride, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The Indominus arrives and destroys their sphere, but the boys manage to evade it and find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center. They repair an old 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara and drive back to the park resort. Claire and Owen search for the boys, but encounter the Indominus and barely escape. Masrani and two troopers hunt the Indominus by helicopter, but when the Indominus breaks into the park's aviary to escape the gunfire, it releases a flock of the pterosaurs Pteranodon and Dimorphodon that collide with the helicopter, causing it to crash, killing Masrani and his troops. The pterosaurs then attack the resort itself; in the chaos, Zara is carried off by pterosaurs before falling into the park's lagoon and being devoured by the park's Mosasaurus. Gray and Zach eventually find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed personnel subdue the pterosaurs with tranquilizers.
Assuming command, Hoskins orders that the raptors should be used to track the Indominus; Owen is forced to accept Hoskins's plan and release the raptors. Upon finding the Indominus, the dinosaurs begin communicating with one another. Owen realizes that the Indominus includes raptor DNA, and it becomes the raptor pack's new alpha, taking command away from Owen. The Indominus escapes when the troops shoot at it, and the raptors hunt down and kill most of the team. Hoskins arranges for Dr. Henry Wu to leave the island by helicopter with the dinosaur embryos, in order to protect his research. Owen, Claire and the boys find Hoskins at the lab, with more staff packing up the remaining embryos. Hoskins reveals his plan to create other hybrid dinosaurs like Indominus for use as superweapons, but a raptor breaks in and mauls him to death.
Owen re-establishes his bond with the raptors before the Indominus reappears. The raptors attack the Indominus, but three of the four are killed. Claire lures the park's Tyrannosaurus rex into a battle with the Indominus. The two dinosaurs fight, with the Indominus gaining the upper hand until Blue, the lone surviving raptor, joins the battle. Overwhelmed, the Indominus is backed up to the lagoon, where the Mosasaurus leaps out and drags it underwater. The T. rex retreats, followed by Blue, who turns to acknowledge Owen before leaving. Isla Nublar is once again abandoned, and the survivors are successfully evacuated to the mainland. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, while the T. rex roams freely on Isla Nublar.",adventure science fiction brother zach gray mitchell visit isla nublar site original jurassic park new theme park name jurassic world operate year simon masrani park owner encourage geneticist dr henry wu create hybrid dinosaur attract visitor boy meet aunt claire dearing park operation manager claire assign assistant zara guide boy evade explore resort owen grady navy veteran research intelligence park velociraptor ingen security chief vic hoskin believe raptor train military use despite objection owen assistant barry masrani owen evaluate enclosure park new hybrid dinosaur indominus rex attraction open owen warn claire danger raise indominus isolation point lack socialization animal discover indominus escape owen enter enclosure able camouflage mask heat signature indominu suddenly appear devour owen companion escape island interior owen suggest indominu kill masrani instead send specialized unit equip non lethal weaponry capture unit kill claire order evacuation island northern sector explore park gyrosphere ride zach gray enter restricted area indominus arrive destroy sphere boy manage evade find ruin original jurassic park visitor center repair old jeep wrangl sahara drive park resort claire owen search boy encounter indominus barely escape masrani trooper hunt indominus helicopter indominus break park aviary escape gunfire release flock pterosaur pteranodon dimorphodon collide helicopter cause crash kill masrani troop pterosaur attack resort chaos zara carry pterosaur fall park lagoon devour park mosasaurus gray zach eventually find owen claire resort armed personnel subdue pterosaur tranquilizer assume command hoskin order raptor track indominus owen force accept hoskin plan release raptor find indominus dinosaur begin communicate owen realize indominus include raptor dna raptor pack new alpha take command away owen indominus escape troop shoot raptor hunt kill team hoskin arrange dr henry wu leave island helicopter dinosaur embryo order protect research owen claire boy find hoskin lab staff pack remain embryo hoskin reveal plan create hybrid dinosaur like indominu use superweapon raptor break maul death owen establish bond raptor indominus reappear raptor attack indominus kill claire lure park tyrannosaurus rex battle indominus dinosaur fight indominus gain upper hand blue lone survive raptor join battle overwhelmed indominus back lagoon mosasaurus leap drag underwater rex retreats follow blue turn acknowledge owen leave isla nublar abandon survivor successfully evacuate mainland zach gray reunite parent rex roam freely isla nublar

Beginning of the End,sci-fi,"The film opens with newspaper photojournalist Audrey Aimes (Castle) accidentally stumbling upon a small town (Ludlow, Illinois) which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby United States Department of Agriculture experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.
Gigantic mutant locusts rampage over the countryside. Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of a city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for the city of Chicago. Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson (Ankrum), Colonel Sturgeon (Henry), and Captain Barton (Seay) to strategize a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and begin to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings.
General Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts en masse is to use a nuclear weapon and destroy Chicago. However, Dr. Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into Lake Michigan. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The lure itself will be a decoy locust mating call, generated electronically with test-tone oscillators. The plan is put into effect, and it works at the last possible moment. The monstrous locusts drown, but Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops. They ponder whether the whole world might be facing an attack of monstrous creatures.",sci fi film open newspaper photojournalist audrey aime castle accidentally stumble small town ludlow illinois inexplicably destroy people town miss evidence indicate dead incredibly local field barren swarm locust eat crop aim suspect military cover travel nearby united states department agriculture experimental farm learn creature cause agricultural destruction meet dr ed wainwright grave experiment radiation means grow gigantic fruit vegetable end world hunger dr wainwright report number mysterious incident nearby locust eat radioactive wheat store nearby grain silo gigantic mutant locust rampage countryside dr wainwright ms aime begin track source mysterious occurrence quickly discover locust eat grain grow size city bus monster eat crop area seek human being means sustenance clear head city chicago wainwright aime meet general hanson ankrum colonel sturgeon henry captain barton seay strategize solution machine gun artillery fire ineffective creature far effectively deal united states army illinois national guard call help protect city monster quickly invade chicago begin feast human flesh building general hanson conclude way destroy beast en masse use nuclear weapon destroy chicago dr wainwright realize locust warm weather creature conclude able lure locust lake michigan cold water incapacitate drown lure decoy locust mating generate electronically test tone oscillator plan effect work possible moment monstrous locust drown dr wainwright ms aimes wonder insect animal eat radioactive crop ponder world face attack monstrous creature
Grand Slam,crime,"A seemingly mild-mannered teacher, Professor James Anders (Robinson), is an American working in Rio de Janeiro. Bored with years of teaching, Anders retires and sets about putting together a team to pull off a diamond heist during the Rio Carnival in Brazil.
With the help of a youthful friend, now a successful criminal, Anders recruits a team of four international experts to carry out the robbery: Gregg an English safecracking specialist, Agostino an Italian mechanical and electronics genius, Jean Paul a French playboy (whose job it is to seduce the only woman with a key to the building holding the diamonds, the lovely Mary Ann), and Erich a German ex-military man (at the movie's ending, it will become clear that Anders' young friend had ordered the German to kill the other members of the team after the job is finished).
The team develops a series of mechanical devices to defeat the layers of protection built within the building in which the diamonds are stored, mainly photocells which crisscross the entry corridor, and the new ""Grand Slam 70"" safe system: an alarm triggered by any sound detected near the safe room by means of a sensitive microphone listens for sounds while the safe and its environs are secured. Although the presence of the latter system is found by the team only one day in advance and at first this seems to impose a stop to the entire action, Agostino is able to find a genial solution to overcome the problem, so that the action can start.
The team successfully enters the safe using a pneumatic trestle to bypass the photocell beams by crawling over them, accesses to the safe room with the Mary Ann's key stolen by Jean Pauland, move the safe to the corridor using shaving cream to dampen their sounds, and finally open the safe with specific nitroglycerin charges. However, the following day the police are alerted by Mary Ann, who has found that the safe key had been temporarily taken, and all the four members of the team are killed during their escape.

Yankee Doodle Daffy,animated short,"Porky Pig, a producer, loaded down with luggage and a golf bag, leaves his office in a hurry to board an airplane. Daffy Duck, a talent agent, prevents him from leaving and attempts to secure an audition for his client, a lethargic child performer named ""Sleepy"" Lagoon (a reference to the 1942 Sleepy Lagoon murder). The pitch, intended to demonstrate Sleepy's allegedly wide and varied repertoire, consists of Daffy himself performing an array of musical and stage acts. Sleepy meanwhile stays seated, nonchalantly licking an enormous lollipop and silently commenting on Daffy's ludicrous behavior using signs bearing rebuses.
The songs that Daffy performs include I'm Just Wild About Harry, William Tell Overture and Angel in Disguise (the same song that Bugs Bunny and Sylvester the Cat would sing in The Wabbit Who Came to Supper and Back Alley Oproar, respectively).
Porky, with mounting frustration, repeatedly tries to escape from the pitch. Daffy handily foils each attempt in increasingly improbable ways, including by turning out to be the pilot of Porky's plane and then turning out to be the parachute Porky uses to escape said plane. Admitting defeat, Porky allows Sleepy to audition.
Sleepy calmly leaves his seat and begins to sing in a strong, operatic baritone that is not only surprising given his small stature but also substantially more dramatic than any of the acts Daffy used in the pitch. However, during a high note near the end, he erupts into a long coughing fit before weakly croaking the rest of the line.",animate short porky pig producer load luggage golf bag leave office hurry board airplane daffy duck talent agent prevent leave attempt secure audition client lethargic child performer name sleepy lagoon reference sleepy lagoon murder pitch intend demonstrate sleepy allegedly wide varied repertoire consist daffy perform array musical stage act sleepy stay seat nonchalantly lick enormous lollipop silently comment daffy ludicrous behavior sign bear rebus song daffy perform include wild harry william tell overture angel disguise song bug bunny sylvester cat sing wabbit come supper alley oproar respectively porky mount frustration repeatedly try escape pitch daffy handily foil attempt increasingly improbable way include turn pilot porky plane turn parachute porky use escape say plane admit defeat porky allow sleepy audition sleepy calmly leave seat begin sing strong operatic baritone surprising give small stature substantially dramatic act daffy pitch high note near end erupt long coughing fit weakly croak rest line

Ten Seconds to Hell,war,"In post-war Berlin, British Major Haven (Richard Wattis) recruits members of a returning German bomb disposal unit, Hans Globke (James Goodwin), Peter Tillig (Dave Willock), Wolfgang Sulke (Wesley Addy), Franz Loeffler (Robert Cornthwaite), Karl Wirtz (Chandler) and Eric Koertner (Palance), to defuse unexploded Allied bombs scattered throughout the city.
Delighted by the well-paying position, Karl bets Eric that he will outlive him. Although initially taken aback by the wager, the other men soon agree that half of their salaries will go to the survivors of the dangerous mission in three months' time. The British, in the form of Major Haven (Wattis), provide the men new uniforms and equipment, and assign Frau Bauer (Virginia Baker) as their liaison. Karl volunteers to lead the unit, but the men vote for the reluctant Eric instead.
Later, Karl and Eric move into an Allied-approved boarding house run by pretty young widow Margot Hoefler (Carol), a French woman whose German husband died during the war.
Several weeks go by in which the men successfully and safely defuse numerous bombs; then the men are stunned when young Globke is killed while defusing a British 1000-pound bomb. Suspecting that the bomb has double fuses, Eric asks Haven to request information from British armaments on its design. At the boardinghouse, Karl continually flirts with Margot, to Eric's annoyance. One evening when Margot loudly protests Karl's drunken advances, Eric bursts into Margot's room to help her and Karl retreats, ridiculing Eric for his motives. Deducing that Eric disapproves of her behavior, Margot explains that her uneasy situation as a traitor to the French and an outsider to the Germans has left her jaded and willing to take happiness wherever she can find it. When Eric remains critical, Margot accuses him of denying his own desires.
A few days later, Frau Bauer receives a report that Tillig has been trapped under a live bomb by the partial collapse of a ruined building. With the other men away on assignments, Eric and Karl race to the site, and despite Tillig's protests, inspect the bomb. After Eric defuses the bomb safely, a doctor arrives and upon examining Tillig declares there is no chance for his survival. Refusing to accept the pronouncement, Eric hurries outside to request equipment to lift the bomb, but as Karl expresses his doubts, the building collapses on Tillig and the doctor. Distraught, Eric returns to the boardinghouse where he seeks solace from Margot. The next day, Eric takes Margot to another ruined section of the city and reveals that before the war he was an architect. Eric struggles to conceal his growing feelings for Margot, admitting that he is confused about becoming romantically involved while his life is in danger daily.
Back at headquarters, Haven tells Eric that because of the post-war chaos, they have been unable to gather information on the thousand-pound bombs. When Haven discloses that he knows of Eric's former profession, Karl, unaware that his colleague was an esteemed architect, expresses surprise. Eric tells Haven that he was forced into demolitions when he fell into disfavor for making anti-Nazi political statements. Karl and the other men were all pressed into demolitions as punishment for some indiscretion and all vowed to do everything they could to survive the war. Mocking Eric's growing anxiety, Karl urges him to quit the unit and give up the wager, but Eric refuses.
A month before the wager's deadline, Sulke is killed while defusing a double fused bomb. Eric, Loeffler and the men agree to adhere to the terms of the wager but discuss giving the salaries to Sulke's widow and child. When Eric presents the proposal to Karl, he scoffs at the suggestion, explaining that his motto has always been to look after himself. The next day Loeffler is called to defuse a bomb found in a canal. Later, Eric learns that Loeffler has drowned in the attempt. That afternoon when Margot urges Eric to give up the bet and quit the unit, Eric explains he must know whether he can triumph over Karl's greed and selfishness.
A few days later, Karl is assigned to defuse a thousand-pound bomb and Eric joins him at the site to make an inspection. The men discuss a strategy to avoid the potential second fuse, then Eric departs, but worriedly hovers nearby. After removing the top of the bomb, Karl gently handles the cap then abruptly calls for help, claiming the detonator pin has slipped. Eric rushes in and provides a pencil, which he offers to hold in place of the pin while Karl retrieves his tools from the landing. Moments later, Eric is stunned when the rope Karl used earlier to remove the top pulls tautly across his hand, forcing him to release the pencil. The bomb does not explode, however, and Eric realizes that Karl has tried to kill him. Eric punches Karl in the face. Once Karl gets back on his feet, he says, ""Guess it's still my bomb."" Eric replies, ""Still your bomb."" Eric then gets his coat and walks away. Karl resumes defusing the bomb. Once Eric is a safe distance away, the bomb explodes, killing Karl.

By chance, the mother and child cross paths, but do not recognize each other. When the boy becomes sick, a doctor comes to see him. He discovers that the Tramp is not the boy's father.

Scream... and Die!,horror,"London fashion model Valerie Jennings travels into the countryside with her photographer boyfriend, Terry, who is searching for an abandoned house; he intends to find something there, but does not tell her what it is. They discover the house at nightfall, and while exploring it, Valerie discovers numerous women's passports in a bedroom. Another couple—a woman and an unseen man—enter the house. Panicked, Valerie and Terry hide in a closet. They watch as the woman is brutally murdered with a switchblade. While the killer washes his hands in the bathroom, Valerie flees, unaware that Terry is not following behind her. When she finds the keys to their car missing, she runs into the woods and the killer chases her into an abandoned wrecking yard where she manages to evade him by hiding inside a car.
The next day, Valerie reaches a road and hitchhikes back to London. She enters her apartment, and while standing at the kitchen window, sees Terry's car parked on the street. She finds it unlocked, and inside discovers her modeling portfolio with a photo missing. Perplexed, she goes to Terry's apartment but finds he has not returned home. Panicked, Valerie visits her friend Mike and his girlfriend, Stella, who urge her not to go to the police, fearing she will implicate herself in Terry's burglary. Later at a modeling shoot, Mike introduces Valerie to his friend Paul, a young and shy artist who makes masks for a living. Paul invites Valerie over for dinner, but they are joined by his domineering Aunt Susanna. After Valerie leaves, Paul and Susanna have sex.
Still concerned over Terry's absence, Valerie agrees to bring Mike and Stella to the house. She leads them to the wrecking yard, where they inexplicably find Terry's ravaged car. Despite their efforts, they are unable to find the house. Back in her apartment building, Valerie becomes unnerved by the presence of Mr. Hornby, an eccentric new neighbor who moves in below her, and who keeps pigeons in his home. She is relieved when her flatmate Lorna, also a model, returns from a job out of town. One night while Valerie is out with friends, an intruder breaks into the apartment and murders Lorna after raping her.
Unsettled by Lorna's murder, Valerie is invited to go out of town with Paul, to which she agrees. He takes her to a remote manor house owned by his family. While there, he confesses to her that his father committed suicide in the home. At night, Valerie hears noises coming from upstairs, but Paul assures her no one is there. She goes to investigate, and notices a taxidermy animal identical to one she saw in the house she entered with Terry; she realizes she is in the same house as before. In the bedroom upstairs, she discovers a blood-stained bed. Hearing someone come up the stairs, she again hides in the closet, and sees Susanna enter the room, calling for Paul and chastising him.

Cobra,action,"An armed gunman causes a hostage situation at a Los Angeles supermarket. When negotiations between him and law enforcement fail, the LAPD summons Lieutenant Marion Cobretti (Stallone), a member of the agency's elite division known as the ""Zombie Squad"". Cobretti, known by the codename ""Cobra"", infiltrates the store, locates, and negotiates with him.
During the negotiation, the gunman speaks of the unknown organization known as ""The New World"", a supremacist group of social darwinist radicals that despise modern society and believe in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule the world. Cobretti then kills the gunman by throwing a knife at his abdomen and firing shots at him.
As the hostages and bodies are removed from the store, Cobretti is admonished by Detective Monte (Robinson) for his seeming disregard for police procedures and protocols. Harassed by reporters, Cobretti admonishes them for failing to prioritize the safety of potential victims. Little does everyone realize at the time is that the supermarket hostage crisis is only one of a string of recent and seemingly unconnected acts of violence and murder that have broken loose in Los Angeles, perpetrated by the same supremacist group the supermarket gunman mentioned.
Model and businesswoman Ingrid Knudsen (Nielsen) later becomes the organization's main target after witnessing their members, including the organization's leader, only identified as ""The Night Slasher"" (Thompson), going on a spree killing. She is placed under the protective custody of Cobretti and his partner, Sergeant Tony Gonzales (Santoni) after a failed attempt on her by the organization. Several more failed attempts are made on their lives by various people connected to the Order. Cobretti theorizes that there is an entire army of killers operating with the same modus operandi rather than a lone serial killer with some associates, but his suggestion is rebuffed by his superiors. However, the LAPD agrees with Cobretti that it will be safest if he and Knudsen relocate from the city.
Cobretti becomes romantically involved with Ingrid shortly after venturing out into the countryside, but Nancy Stalk (Garlington), the organization's second-in-command and right-hand person disguised as a police officer escorting the Cobretti party, reveals the location of their whereabouts. Despite Cobretti's suspicions and mistrust of Nancy, he does nothing and the party spends the night in a motel. The organization moves in at dawn and besieges the small town. With barely enough time to react, the attackers storm Cobretti and Ingrid's motel, wounding Gonzales in the process. Killing several members but with more swarming into the town, Cobretti and Ingrid escape in a pickup truck. When the truck is severely damaged from the chase, the duo cut through a grapefruit plantation to escape into a nearby factory.
Cobretti has defeated most of the organization by this point, with the few remaining members following them into the building. After eliminating every member except for the Night Slasher himself, Cobretti engages in a vicious melee combat with him inside the steel mill, ending with the Night Slasher being impaled in the back by a large roaming hook, then burned alive.
In the aftermath, Cobretti's department arrives and begins clean-up of the town, giving medical aid to Gonzales. Detective Monte appears apologetic but confronts Cobretti again about his lack of regard to police protocols, offering to discuss the issue over a long dinner. Cobretti punches Monte instead, and the film ends with Cobretti and Ingrid riding away on one of the motorcycles left by the organization.",action armed gunman cause hostage situation los angeles supermarket negotiation law enforcement fail lapd summon lieutenant marion cobretti stallone member agency elite division know zombie squad cobretti know codename cobra infiltrate store locate negotiate negotiation gunman speak unknown organization know new world supremacist group social darwinist radical despise modern society believe kill weak leave strong smart rule world cobretti kill gunman throw knife abdomen fire shot hostage body remove store cobretti admonish detective monte robinson disregard police procedure protocol harass reporter cobretti admonish fail prioritize safety potential victim little realize time supermarket hostage crisis string recent seemingly unconnected act violence murder break loose los angeles perpetrate supremacist group supermarket gunman mention model businesswoman ingrid knudsen nielsen later organization main target witness member include organization leader identify night slasher thompson go spree killing place protective custody cobretti partner sergeant tony gonzales santoni fail attempt organization fail attempt life people connect order cobretti theorize entire army killer operate modus operandi lone serial killer associate suggestion rebuff superior lapd agree cobretti safest knudsen relocate city cobretti romantically involve ingrid shortly venture countryside nancy stalk garlington organization second command right hand person disguise police officer escort cobretti party reveal location whereabouts despite cobretti suspicion mistrust nancy party spend night motel organization move dawn besiege small town barely time react attacker storm cobretti ingrid motel wound gonzale process kill member swarm town cobretti ingrid escape pickup truck truck severely damage chase duo cut grapefruit plantation escape nearby factory cobretti defeat organization point remain member follow building eliminate member night slasher cobretti engage vicious melee combat inside steel mill end night slasher impale large roam hook burn alive aftermath cobretti department arrive begin clean town give medical aid gonzales detective monte appear apologetic confront cobretti lack regard police protocol offer discuss issue long dinner cobretti punches monte instead film end cobretti ingrid ride away motorcycle leave organization

Rookie of the Year,comedy,"Henry Rowengartner (Nicholas), 12-year-old Little Leaguer, has dreams of playing in the major leagues, although he is not very skilled. One day, Henry breaks his arm trying to catch a fly ball (he slips on another ball that is lying on the ground) and has to wrap it in a cast. Once the arm is healed, the doctor removes the cast and discovers Henry's tendons have healed ""a little too tight,"" thus enabling Henry to cock his arm back and fire it forward with incredible force.
A fateful trip to Wrigley Field for a Chicago Cubs game results in Henry's friends getting a home run ball hit by the visiting team, the Montreal Expos. However, when they give it to Henry to throw back onto the field (per Wrigley tradition), his tightly-healed arm throws the ball so hard that it reaches home plate on the fly. Looking for a miracle to save the club, which is suffering slumping attendance, general manager Larry Fisher (Hedaya) begins efforts to get Henry to join the Cubs. Manager Sal Martinella visits Henry at home to scout him, bringing a radar gun, and discovers that Henry now has the ability to regularly pitch at over 100 miles per hour.
For the remainder of the season, Henry has to juggle the culture shock of actually playing in the major leagues—working with one of his heroes, aging pitcher Chet ""Rocket"" Steadman (Busey) and spending time with his friends. Under it all, his mother, Mary (Amy Morton), tries to keep him grounded while resisting attempts by Fisher and her boyfriend, Jack (Altman), to exploit his newfound fame.
Henry's first game is a relief appearance against the New York Mets, in which he gives up a home run to the Mets' feared slugger Heddo (Tom Milanovich), an arrogant player who taunts him while at the plate and rounding the bases. Despite wanting to quit after the game, he then shows marked improvement under the tutoring of Steadman, and records a second consecutive save against the San Francisco Giants capped off with his first MLB strikeout.
Continuing to impress leading into and during a road game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Henry bats for the first time, and his extremely small stature (and subsequent extremely small strike zone) frustrates the Dodger pitcher to the point where he walks on four straight pitches. He subsequently scores a run, followed by an adult player who scores behind him (they are limited by Henry's speed, as baseball rules dictate that a trailing runner cannot overtake another runner in front or they will be called out.)
During the course of the season, relationships begin to get strained, as Henry gets into a fight with his friends who have grown increasingly jealous of his star status, and Mary breaks up with Jack over a supposed endorsement deal that was actually a free-agent contract unknowingly signed by Henry to join the New York Yankees the next season. Eventually, Henry resolves the conflict with his friends, and when he asks team owner Bob Carson (Bracken) about the contract with the Yankees, Carson explains that he never authorized such a deal, and that he wants to retain Henry's services for the remainder of the season. At this point, Henry tells Carson that he will retire at the end of the season. Carson is at first disappointed but respects Henry's decision and wishes him the best of luck and then proceeds to demote Fisher to Hot Dog Salesman after finding out that it was Fisher who tried to set up the deal.
On the last day of the season, presumably the deciding game for the National League Eastern Division seat, the Cubs face the Mets once again at Wrigley Field, with Steadman starting. At first, Steadman finds ""the Rocket"" as he pitches well, but then by the 6th inning, feels pain in his arm each time he throws, eventually allowing the Mets to load the bases. However, he makes one final play, and despite damaging his arm, managed to tag a runner out at home, and subsequently turns the ball over to Henry. As before, Henry easily strikes out the side in the seventh and eighth innings, but in the top of the ninth, he slips on a loose baseball and lands on his side, reversing the effects of his first fall and reducing his arm strength to normal again.
Henry begins to frustrate the Cubs and their fans by refusing to throw pitches that his catcher signals for, and only throws once the catcher stands up, setting up an intentional walk. He then brings in the disappointed Cubs players, explaining why he can no longer throw fastballs, and sends them back to their positions with a plan he came up with. With their cooperation, Henry sneaks the ball to the first baseman, who subsequently tags the runner out. Henry then issues an intentional walk to the next batter, with whom he trades insults. When the runner dares him to throw the ball high, Henry starts to do so, but stops as the runner takes off for second. He is tagged out as well, setting up a final showdown with Heddo, who had hit the home run in Henry's debut and gloats as he recalls that moment. Henry has an idea and throws a changeup, which Heddo swings at and misses. Heddo hits the next pitch down the left-field line and into the bleachers, but it is ruled a foul ball; this angers Heddo, who tells Henry that he ""has nothing"". Henry opens his glove to find not his father's name, but Mary's. He looks to her in the stands and she confirms that she – not his father – was the ballplayer who was his parent. She then signals him to throw a floater, an unusual pitch that rises very high in the air. He does so, and strikes out a shocked Heddo (who, in a humorous reversal of fortunes, breaks down and cries like a baby, pounding the dirt with his fists) to win the pennant for the Cubs.
The next spring, Henry is playing Little League baseball again, with Steadman and Mary as the coaches of his team. After catching a home run ball that ensures victory, while celebrating with his teammates, raises his fist to the camera and reveals he is wearing a Cubs World Series championship ring, signifying he helped the Cubs win the World Series (even though he did not pitch in it).",comedy henry rowengartner nicholas year old little leaguer dream play major league skilled day henry break arm try catch fly ball slip ball lie ground wrap cast arm heal doctor remove cast discover henry tendon heal little tight enable henry cock arm fire forward incredible force fateful trip wrigley field chicago cubs game result henry friend get home run ball hit visit team montreal expos henry throw field wrigley tradition tightly heal arm throw ball hard reach home plate fly look miracle save club suffer slump attendance general manager larry fisher hedaya begin effort henry join cub manager sal martinella visit henry home scout bring radar gun discover henry ability regularly pitch mile hour remainder season henry juggle culture shock actually play major league work hero age pitcher chet rocket steadman busey spend time friend mother mary amy morton try ground resist attempt fisher boyfriend jack altman exploit newfound fame henry game relief appearance new york met give home run met feared slugger heddo tom milanovich arrogant player taunt plate round basis despite want quit game show marked improvement tutoring steadman record second consecutive save san francisco giants cap mlb strikeout continue impress lead road game los angeles dodger henry bat time extremely small stature subsequent extremely small strike zone frustrate dodger pitcher point walk straight pitch subsequently score run follow adult player score limit henry speed baseball rule dictate trail runner overtake runner call course season relationship begin strain henry get fight friend grow increasingly jealous star status mary break jack suppose endorsement deal actually free agent contract unknowingly sign henry join new york yankees season eventually henry resolve conflict friend ask team owner bob carson bracken contract yankees carson explain authorize deal want retain henry service remainder season point henry tell carson retire end season carson disappointed respect henry decision wish good luck proceed demote fisher hot dog salesman find fisher try set deal day season presumably decide game national league eastern division seat cub face met wrigley field steadman start steadman find rocket pitch inning feel pain arm time throw eventually allow met load basis make final play despite damage arm manage tag runner home subsequently turn ball henry henry easily strike seventh eighth innings ninth slip loose baseball land reverse effect fall reduce arm strength normal henry begin frustrate cub fan refuse throw pitch catcher signal throw catcher stand set intentional walk bring disappoint cub player explain long throw fastball send position plan come cooperation henry sneak ball baseman subsequently tag runner henry issue intentional walk batter trade insult runner dare throw ball high henry start stop runner take second tag set final showdown heddo hit home run henry debut gloat recall moment henry idea throw changeup heddo swing miss heddo hit pitch left field line bleacher rule foul ball anger heddo tell henry henry open glove find father mary look stand confirm father ballplayer parent signal throw floater unusual pitch rise high air strike shocked heddo humorous reversal fortune break cry like baby pound dirt fist win pennant cub spring henry play little league baseball steadman mary coach team catch home run ball ensure victory celebrate teammate raise fist camera reveal wear cub world series championship ring signify help cub win world series pitch
The Magnificent Seven Ride,western,"In southern Arizona Territory, former hired gun-turned-marshal Chris Adams rescues his old friend, former bounty hunter Jim Mackay from an ambush. After recovering from his long ride across the desert, Jim asks Chris to help him defend the small Mexican border town of Magdalena, which has come under constant attack by bandit De Toro and his men. Having recently married and assumed his job as marshal, however, Chris is reluctant to assist Jim, despite their long friendship.
Later, Chris refuses the request of his wife Arrila to release jailed teenager Shelly Donavan, who is charged with robbery, insisting that Donavan needs to be responsible for his actions. Chris then meets with newspaper writer Noah Forbes who wants to write the story of Chris's eventful and brutal career.
The next morning, while loading bitter prisoners Pepe Carral, Walt Drummond and Donavan onto the Tucson prison wagon transport, Chris abruptly decides to let Donavan go free. While Chris meets Noah to discuss his exploits, Donavan joins his friends, brothers Hank and Bob Allen to celebrate his release. Goaded into action by the Allens' observation that their drab lives as farmers remain unchanged, Donavan leads the pair in a bank robbery just as Arrila meets Chris and Noah in the street outside the bank. Wounding Chris, Donavan abducts Arrila and rides away with the Allens. Reviving two days later, Chris immediately goes in search of Arrila, despite his injury, and agrees to let Noah accompany him.
In the desert, Noah and Chris find Arrila's dead body, which galvanizes Chris to find Donavan and exact revenge. That night, Chris tracks down the Allens and demands to know Donavan's whereabouts. Confident that Chris, as marshal, must take them back to town for a trial unharmed, Hank reveals that Donavan has fled to Mexico and admits that Arrila was raped and tortured before her murder. Chris shoots Hank, and Bob, pleading for his life, insists that he did not join in the assault. Accusing him of allowing Arrila's attack, Chris then shoots Bob as Noah looks on in shock.
Continuing his search for Donavan, Chris rides on toward the Mexican border and finds Jim with a group of armed farmers from Magdalena hiding on a ridge, hoping to ambush De Toro. After Jim reveals that Donavan rode by the previous day, he again asks Chris to support him, but Chris refuses and tells his friend he is badly outnumbered and will be slaughtered. Chris and Noah depart, tracking Donavan through the desert, only to find themselves circling back toward Jim's location. Hearing distant gunfire, the men hurry to the ridge, but find the farmers dead, although Jim is not among them. Chris reflects that the men of Magdalena have likely left their wives unprotected and, assuming Jim will have returned there, rides into Mexico with the uncertain Noah.
Arriving in Magdalena, Chris spots three bandits around the mission and after shooting them, enters the church to find the handful of townswomen who have been raped and beaten. Laurie Gunn explains that the seventeen women were defenseless against De Toro and his more than forty men who arrived the previous day declaring the women's husbands had been massacred. Although Laurie and the women plead with Chris to take them away from Magdalena before De Toro's return, he points out there are no horses and a desert trek would kill them. Realizing that the American Cavalry will not cross the border, Chris wonders how to defend the women. Promising to return to help the frantic women, Chris and Noah ride away toward Tucson. Not far from Magdalena, the pair come upon the bodies of Jim, Donavan and the remaining farmers.
At Tucson, Chris meets with the governor then travels to the prison where he presents the skeptical warden with a request to pardon the last five prisoners he arrested, all of whom are tough, violent men: Pepe Carrall, Walt Drummond, Scott Elliott, Mark Skinner and former Confederate captain Andy Hayes. Meeting the men, Chris explains he will sign their pardons only if they agree to join his posse. Although suspicious and hostile, the men grudgingly agree. Loaded with supplies from the prison, the group departs for De Toro's hacienda, which Jim had described earlier. Arriving just outside the hacienda and confirming that only a few men are posted as guards, Chris tells the men to raid the house and take anything they desire. Although doubtful, the men agree and quickly overcome the guards and loot the home. Finding De Toro's woman there, Chris orders her taken captive and as the men ride off to Magdalena, Chris tells the men that if they try to escape before he signs the pardons, they will be hunted in America and De Toro will hound them through Mexico for destroying his home. Realizing they have no alternative, the men give up their ideas of breaking away in Mexico and continue to Magdalena where Laurie and the grateful women wait.
Suspecting they may have only a day to prepare before De Toro tracks them, Chris designs an elaborate plan of attack using the supplies of long-range rifles, dynamite, barbed wire and repeating rifles. The next day with the women's assistance and under former construction worker Elliott's guidance, the group digs several ditches, building several post and barbed wire fences at specific points leading back into the town. Elliott also constructs hidden barriers across mountain trails into the town. The following day, with the women trained in reloading the weapons, the group awaits De Toro's arrival. When the bandits attack, the initial assault with the long-range guns, sends the outlaws into disarray. Chris and the others retreat as planned to the second line of defense, which, protected by Elliott's clever rigged barbed fence, cuts off another large segment of the bandits who are then dynamited. Walt, Hayes and Elliott are killed and Noah wounded as the group retreats into the town behind another rigged barricade.
During a brief lull, Chris goes into the mission where De Toro's woman and the town children are being kept, and tells Laurie that as a last resort they will lure the bandits inside and blow up the church. When De Toro's renewed assault comes, Pepe is killed. Hearing the bandits approaching the mission, Laurie prepares to detonate the dynamite, but first sets De Toro's woman free. The woman rushes outside into the gunfight and is accidentally shot down by De Toro himself. Momentarily stunned, De Toro pauses, and Chris kills him. Dismayed by the death of their leader, the remaining bandits ride away.
Relieved to have survived, Chris, Noah and Skinner agree to stay in Magdalena and start new lives.",western southern arizona territory hire gun turn marshal chris adams rescue old friend bounty hunter jim mackay ambush recover long ride desert jim ask chris help defend small mexican border town magdalena come constant attack bandit de toro man having recently marry assume job marshal chris reluctant assist jim despite long friendship later chris refuse request wife arrila release jail teenager shelly donavan charge robbery insist donavan need responsible action chris meet newspaper writer noah forbe want write story chris eventful brutal career morning load bitter prisoner pepe carral walt drummond donavan tucson prison wagon transport chris abruptly decide let donavan free chris meet noah discuss exploit donavan join friend brother hank bob allen celebrate release goad action allen observation drab life farmer remain unchanged donavan lead pair bank robbery arrila meet chris noah street outside bank wound chris donavan abduct arrila ride away allen revive day later chris immediately go search arrila despite injury agree let noah accompany desert noah chris find arrila dead body galvanize chris find donavan exact revenge night chris track allen demand know donavan whereabout confident chris marshal town trial unharmed hank reveal donavan flee mexico admit arrila rape torture murder chris shoots hank bob plead life insist join assault accuse allow arrila attack chris shoot bob noah look shock continue search donavan chris ride mexican border find jim group armed farmer magdalena hide ridge hope ambush de toro jim reveal donavan ride previous day ask chris support chris refuse tell friend badly outnumber slaughter chris noah depart track donavan desert find circle jim location hear distant gunfire man hurry ridge find farmer dead jim chris reflect man magdalena likely leave wife unprotected assume jim return ride mexico uncertain noah arrive magdalena chris spot bandit mission shoot enter church find handful townswoman rape beat laurie gunn explain seventeen woman defenseless de toro man arrive previous day declare woman husband massacre laurie woman plead chris away magdalena de toro return point horse desert trek kill realize american cavalry cross border chris wonder defend woman promise return help frantic woman chris noah ride away tucson far magdalena pair come body jim donavan remain farmer tucson chris meet governor travel prison present skeptical warden request pardon prisoner arrest tough violent man pepe carrall walt drummond scott elliott mark skinner confederate captain andy hayes meet man chris explain sign pardon agree join posse suspicious hostile man grudgingly agree load supply prison group depart de toro hacienda jim describe early arrive outside hacienda confirm man post guard chris tell man raid house desire doubtful man agree quickly overcome guard loot home find de toro woman chris order take captive man ride magdalena chris tell man try escape sign pardon hunt america de toro hound mexico destroy home realize alternative man idea break away mexico continue magdalena laurie grateful woman wait suspect day prepare de toro track chris design elaborate plan attack supply long range rifle dynamite barbed wire repeat rifle day woman assistance construction worker elliott guidance group dig ditch build post barbed wire fence specific point lead town elliott construct hide barrier mountain trail town follow day woman train reload weapon group await de toro arrival bandit attack initial assault long range gun send outlaws disarray chris retreat plan second line defense protect elliott clever rig barbed fence cut large segment bandit dynamite walt haye elliott kill noah wound group retreat town rig barricade brief lull chris go mission de toro woman town child keep tell laurie resort lure bandit inside blow church de toro renew assault come pepe kill hear bandit approach mission laurie prepare detonate dynamite set de toro woman free woman rush outside gunfight accidentally shoot de toro momentarily stun de toro pause chris kill dismay death leader remain bandit ride away relieve survive chris noah skinner agree stay magdalena start new life
The Guilt of Janet Ames,drama,"Bitter war widow Janet Ames (Rosalind Russell) seeks out the five soldiers for whom her husband gave his life by falling on a hand grenade during the Battle of the Bulge. While crossing a city street to find the first, she is struck and knocked unconscious by an automobile. The police find no identification on her, only a list of names. One recognizes the last name on her list, Smithfield ""Smitty"" Cobb (Melvyn Douglas), a reporter recently fired for alcoholism, and contacts Smitty. When Smitty sees the list, he realizes who she must be.
He goes to see her at the hospital, and finds her in a wheelchair, unable to walk. As the doctor can find no physical reason for the paralysis, he schedules an appointment with a psychiatrist. Smitty decides to treat her himself. He introduces himself as a friend of her husband David (though not as one of the men he saved), and wheels her into a private room. She explains her mission: to see if any of the men were worth David's sacrifice, making it perfectly clear that she has already made up her mind. After a nurse gives her a sedative, Smitty accuses her of wallowing in self-pity, then tries to get Janet to change her mind by describing each of the men. He is so vivid that Janet can see and talk to them.
The first man she interacts with is nightclub bouncer Joe Burton (Richard Benedict). He and his singer girlfriend Katie (Betsy Blair) dream of building a house. Joe constructs a model of it from a deck of cards. Exasperated by their unrealistic aspirations, Janet blows the cards down.
Next, Smitty takes her to the desert, where Ed Pierson is doing scientific research and living in a shack with his wife Susie (Nina Foch). Janet does not meet Ed at all; instead, she talks with Susie and her very wealthy father, who strongly disapproves of what the couple are doing. He wants Ed to come work for him, but Susie replies that Ed is happy where he is and would be miserable in the business world. Janet states that her husband would never do what Ed has done.
The third man is Frank Merino (played by an uncredited Hugh Beaumont). Janet first meets his young daughter Emmy. During their conversation, Janet states that she and David were too sensible to have children before they were ready and that children are a lot of trouble. A bewildered Emmy seeks comfort from her father.
Sammy Weaver (Sid Caesar), the fourth man, is a promising, up-and-coming comedian. After entertaining Janet and Smitty with his routine, he thanks her for the opportunity to lift the spirits of his audience.
By this point, Janet has guessed Smitty's identity. He describes himself as a crusading journalist and newspaper editor.
Janet then admits that she feels overwhelming guilt in not loving her husband and making his civilian life so miserable, he had little to lose when he sacrificed himself. David wanted to build a house and have a child right away, but she put them off until it was too late. She also made him decline a research position and keep working at a job he hated for her own security. Smitty persuades her to forgive herself, and the paralysis in her legs goes away.
However, when she tells him that she has fallen in love with him, he brushes her off and retreats to his favorite bar to drown his own troubles. Janet then learns from a policeman that Smitty is not exactly what he claimed. She tracks him down and extracts from him the reason for his alcoholism. It turns out Smitty, as David's commanding officer, ordered him to throw himself on the grenade, when Smitty was just as close to it. Janet tells him that David would have done so without being ordered, and that he probably never even heard the command. She then turns the tables on her healer, describing their happy future life together.",drama bitter war widow janet ame rosalind russell seek soldier husband give life fall hand grenade battle bulge cross city street find strike knock unconscious automobile police find identification list name recognize list smithfield smitty cobb melvyn douglas reporter recently fire alcoholism contact smitty smitty see list realize go hospital find wheelchair unable walk doctor find physical reason paralysis schedule appointment psychiatrist smitty decide treat introduce friend husband david man save wheel private room explain mission man worth david sacrifice make perfectly clear mind nurse give sedative smitty accuse wallow self pity try janet change mind describe man vivid janet talk man interact nightclub bouncer joe burton richard benedict singer girlfriend katie betsy blair dream build house joe construct model deck card exasperate unrealistic aspiration janet blow card smitty take desert ed pierson scientific research live shack wife susie nina foch janet meet ed instead talk susie wealthy father strongly disapprove couple want ed come work susie reply ed happy miserable business world janet state husband ed man frank merino play uncredited hugh beaumont janet meet young daughter emmy conversation janet state david sensible child ready child lot trouble bewildered emmy seek comfort father sammy weaver sid caesar fourth man promising come comedian entertain janet smitty routine thank opportunity lift spirit audience point janet guess smitty identity describe crusading journalist newspaper editor janet admit feel overwhelming guilt love husband make civilian life miserable little lose sacrifice david want build house child right away late decline research position work job hate security smitty persuade forgive paralysis leg go away tell fall love brush retreat favorite bar drown trouble janet learn policeman smitty exactly claim track extract reason alcoholism turn smitty david command officer order throw grenade smitty close janet tell david order probably hear command turn table healer describe happy future life
Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance,chambara,"Set in Japan during an unspecific year of the Edo period, Ogami Ittō, disgraced former executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin, to the shōgun, wanders the countryside, pushing a baby cart with his 3-year-old son Daigoro inside. A banner hangs off his back. ""Ogami: Suiouryo technique"" (Child and expertise for rent)(子を[son] 貸し[for hire] 腕 [arm|skill] 貸し[for hire] つかまつる [to serve] 水 鷗流 [Suiouryo] 拜一刀 [ogami ittō]), it says. His services are asked for in a most unexpected way, when an insane woman seizes Daigoro from the cart and proceeds to try to breastfeed the boy. Daigoro at first hesitates, but after stern look from his father, he proceeds to suckle the crazy woman's breast. The woman's mother then apologizes for her daughter's behavior and tries to give Ittō money, but the stoic rōnin refuses, saying his son was hungry anyway.
As he walks in the rain, he remembers another rainy day several months earlier when his wife, Asami, was slain by three ninjas, ostensibly in revenge for Ittō's execution of a boy daimyō, but it was really part of a complicated plot by the shōgun's inspector Bizen and the ""Shadow"" Yagyū Clan to frame Ittō for treason and take over the executioner's post.
Now a wandering assassin for hire, Ittō takes a job from a Chamberlain, to kill a rival and his gang of henchmen, who pose a threat to the chamberlain's lord. The chamberlain plans to test Ittō, but a quick slash behind his back with his Dōtanuki sword dispatches the chamberlain's two men. The targets are in a remote mountain village that is home to hot-spring spa pools.
As Ittō pushes the baby cart, and Daigoro observes scenes of nature, such as a mother dog suckling one puppy, and two children singing a song and bouncing a ball, Ittō thinks back again to the time just after his wife was killed. He gave Daigoro a choice between a toy ball or the sword. If the child chose the ball, Ittō would put him to death send him to be with his mother – a better place in his opinion. But the curious child reaches for the sword – he has chosen to take the path of the ronin with his father, to live like demons at the crossroads to hell.
Eventually, Ittō reaches the hot-spring village. He finds that the rival chamberlain and his men have hired a band of ronins who have taken over the town and are raping, looting and pillaging. Ittō is forced to give up his sword and take his place as a hostage in the village.
The ronins discuss killing Ittō, but then decide to let him live if he will have sex with the town's remaining prostitute while they watch. The prostitute refuses to have any part in it, but then she's threatened by one of the men, a knife expert, and in order to save the woman, Ittō steps forward and disrobes, saying he will do the men's bidding with the woman.
The episode takes one more trip back to the past, for the dramatic beheading and blood-spurting scene in which Ittō defeats one of Yagyū Retsudo's best swordsman, with the aid of a mirror on Daigoro's forehead to reflect the sun into the swordsman's eyes.
And then there is the big showdown in the village, where it is revealed that the baby cart harbors some secrets – various edged weapons, including a spear-like naginata, which Ittō uses to take out the evil chamberlain's men, chopping one off at his knees, leaving the bloody stumps of his lower legs still standing on the ground.
One of the men has matchlock pistols, but Ittō quickly upturns the baby cart, which is revealed to be armored underneath, and when the gunman's pistols are empty, Ittō quickly leaps over the baby cart and brings his blade down on the man's forehead, splitting it in two.

Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,comedy,"After finding success with a DNA restructuring formula in the first film, Sherman Klump has created another formula which enables those who take it to find the Fountain of Youth. He has also met and fallen in love with a colleague, Denise Gaines, who has developed a method to isolate genetic material and later becomes his fiancée. Together, their work has enabled Wellman College to receive a $150 million award from a pharmaceutical firm to the excitement of Dean Richmond. Despite his good fortune, Sherman has a major problem: the personality of his vanquished alter ego, Buddy Love, is still ingrained inside him and causes him to act out in the same crass manner Buddy does. Sherman tries proposing to Denise, but then Buddy kicks in and makes it a perverted sex request, causing Denise to become mortified against him.
Determined to be rid of Buddy permanently, and despite Jason warning him of potentially catastrophic consequences for his health, Sherman uses Denise's methodology to isolate and remove the gene in Sherman's DNA where Buddy has manifested and extracts it from inside his body. However, he does not dispose of the genetic material and as a result, Buddy becomes a sentient being when a hair from a Basset Hound who was Sherman's test subject finds its way into it and causes such a reaction. To make matters worse, Jason's suspicions prove correct when Sherman discovers that, due to the extraction, his brain cells are beginning to deteriorate.
Realizing he needs to keep the youth formula out of Buddy's hands, Sherman stashes it at his parents' house. Buddy, who is trying to sell the formula to a different company, quickly realizes where it is and steals some of it. Buddy also doctors the remainder with fertilizer, which causes chaos at a demonstration the next day when a hamster Sherman uses to demonstrate the youth finding effects instead mutates into an aggressive monster who violates Dean Richmond in front of a live television audience. The humiliated Dean fires Sherman, who learns that his brain's deterioration has worsened from Jason. Sherman then decides to end his engagement and break up with Denise.
In a last-ditch effort to secure the money, Sherman quickly works on a newer, much more potent formula while his mental faculties allow him to. Richmond confronts him about Buddy's actions, believing the two are working together. He leaves with Richmond and a tennis ball and head to the competing firm. Meanwhile, a worried Denise discovers what has happened and that Sherman's brain damage has progressed to almost eighty percent. Enlisting the help of Sherman's father Cletus, Denise goes after him. Sherman takes advantage of the canine DNA that crossed with Buddy's, and uses the tennis ball to play fetch. The ball is covered with the new formula, which takes Buddy back to an infantile state and eventually to a glowing mass of genetic material for Sherman to suck the genetic material back into his body through a straw, thus putting his DNA back together and returning him to normal. However, as Sherman chases what is left of Buddy, the glowing mass evaporates and thus Sherman cannot restore his intelligence.
Denise and Cletus arrive too late to save him, and seeing what has happened to Sherman, Denise breaks into tears. As they go to leave, Sherman takes a look at a fountain and remarks that it is ""pretty"". Seeing that the water is glowing, Denise realizes that the genetic material has reconstituted and that if Sherman drinks the water before it dissipates, he will be restored to normal. Sherman eventually drinks the water with the help of Denise and Cletus, and thus he is able to get his genetic makeup back in proper order.
The film closes with Denise and Sherman's wedding reception, with Buddy nowhere to be found. Dean Richmond rehires Sherman with a wedding present, and the hamster is back to normal and Dean Richmond decides to love the hamster.",comedy find success dna restructure formula film sherman klump create formula enable find fountain youth meet fall love colleague denise gaine develop method isolate genetic material later fiancée work enable wellman college receive million award pharmaceutical firm excitement dean richmond despite good fortune sherman major problem personality vanquished alter ego buddy love ingrained inside cause act crass manner buddy sherman try propose denise buddy kick make perverted sex request cause denise mortified determine rid buddy permanently despite jason warn potentially catastrophic consequence health sherman use denise methodology isolate remove gene sherman dna buddy manifest extract inside body dispose genetic material result buddy sentient hair basset hound sherman test subject find way cause reaction matter bad jason suspicion prove correct sherman discover extraction brain cell begin deteriorate realize need youth formula buddy hand sherman stash parent house buddy try sell formula different company quickly realize steal buddy doctor remainder fertilizer cause chaos demonstration day hamster sherman use demonstrate youth find effect instead mutate aggressive monster violate dean richmond live television audience humiliated dean fire sherman learn brain deterioration worsen jason sherman decide end engagement break denise ditch effort secure money sherman quickly work new potent formula mental faculty allow richmond confront buddy action believe work leave richmond tennis ball head compete firm worried denise discover happen sherman brain damage progress eighty percent enlist help sherman father cletus denise go sherman take advantage canine dna cross buddy use tennis ball play fetch ball cover new formula take buddy infantile state eventually glowing mass genetic material sherman suck genetic material body straw put dna return normal sherman chase leave buddy glowing mass evaporate sherman restore intelligence denise cletus arrive late save see happen sherman denise break tear leave sherman take look fountain remark pretty see water glow denise realize genetic material reconstitute sherman drink water dissipate restore normal sherman eventually drink water help denise cletus able genetic makeup proper order film close denise sherman wedding reception buddy find dean richmond rehire sherman wedding present hamster normal dean richmond decide love hamster
The Hunting Party,western,"Relations are strained between cattle baron Brandt Ruger (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Melissa (Candice Bergen) when he leaves for a two-week hunting trip with some of his wealthy friends.
Mistaking her for a schoolteacher, outlaw Frank Calder (Oliver Reed) and his band of rustlers and thieves kidnap Melissa, not for ransom but because Calder wants to be taught how to read a book.
Traveling by luxurious private train, the hunting party engages in debauchery with women, one of whom Ruger sadistically abuses. Notified that his wife has been taken captive, Ruger arms his friends with high-powered rifles to begin a hunt not for animals but for men.
Calder twice must keep Melissa from being raped by his men. But eventually he overpowers and rapes her himself. Melissa tries to shoot and stab Calder and to flee, each time in vain. She goes on a hunger strike, but cannot resist the temptation of a jar of peaches. She begins to enjoy Calder's company.
Using rifles with telescopic sights that can allow shooting a target at 800 yards, Ruger and his men begin to pick off the outlaws one by one. Melissa also stabs one, Hog Warren (L.Q. Jones), after he attempts a second time to rape her. Calder charges within close range and is able to shoot one of Ruger's men. Two others quit the hunting party when they see Ruger's lack of concern over their friend's death.
Calder's men become upset to discover that they have kidnapped such a powerful man's wife, placing them in danger for no good reason. The men revolt and Calder kills one. When his own best friend, Doc (Mitchell Ryan), is gravely wounded, Calder obeys a last request to put Doc out of his misery.
On his death bed, Hog Warren further angers Ruger by telling him Melissa is now Calder's woman. In yet another ambush, Ruger sees for himself that Melissa, rather than trying to escape, leaps onto Calder's horse voluntarily to ride off with him. Ruger's last remaining ally, Matthew (Simon Oakland), implores him to let her go, but the crazed Ruger pays no mind.
The last of Calder's men are gunned down from long range at a water hole. Alone now, Calder and Melissa are driven out into the desert. Weak from heat and thirst, their horse dead, they stumble toward an inevitable fate. Ruger materializes on foot. He fatally shoots Calder with his rifle. As Calder is dying Ruger kills Melissa. Ruger then collapses beside them.

Athanokkade,action,"The opening scene shows Anjali (Sindhu Tolani) sitting on a bench feeding a white pigeon by a calm ocean, and a retd. DGP police officer Shankar (Ahuti Prasad) coming and sitting by her side and exchanging pleasantries, and suddenly she whips out a knife and kills him with the help of her maternal uncle Ramachandran (Surya), saying that she has been waiting for this moment for many years.
After that, the scene shifts to Ram (Nandamuri Kalyan Ram) who lives with his loving parents (Chandra Mohan and Rajya Lakshmi) and sister in New Delhi. He takes up a course in a Hyderabad college against his parents' wishes. Unable to be separated from Ram, his parents and their daughter come to Hyderabad along with him.
It is revealed that Anjali is studying in the same college as Ram, and she has her own agenda to seek revenge on her family's killers, assisted by Ramachandran. Now the villain Anna (Ashish Vidyarthi), a local gangster enters and is shown to have a dispute with another person Pattabhai (Rami Reddy). To exact their revenge Anjali's uncle attempts to kill one of Anna's aide Abdullah (Raghu Babu) but fails to do so since Ram kills him. Naturally Anna assumes that the killer can be none other than Pattabhi and so kills him. However Ram arrives on the scene and with help from Gulab Singh (Venu Madhav), threatens Anna telling that he was the one who killed Abdullah and that he will also kill Sada (G. V. Sudhakar Naidu), Anna's second main aide. As typical, Sada gets angry, and goes to kill Ram but fails, and Ram kills Abdullah while his parents are watching with horror. On being questioned, Ram tells his story.
Ram's biological father (Prakash Raj) was an honest cop who arrested one of the henchmen of Anna. It is revealed that Anjali and Ram are from the same family, as Anjali's father is Ram's father's brother-in-law. Anna pays Ram's house a visit and asks his grandfather (Chalapati Rao) to let his henchmen go. When Ram's grandfather refuses, Anna threatens them only to find knives held at him by Ram and his cousins. Ram's father arrives and arrests Anna. Infuriated, he pays them a visit with some of his henchmen and Shankar, the then DCP. Together, they murder their whole extended family. Only Anjali, her uncle Ramachandran and Ram survived the blast that annihilated their family. After the house is blown up by Anna, Ram escapes and is taken in by his foster (Chandra Mohan & Rajya Lakshmi) parents. Meanwhile, Anjali feels that one of her family members is still alive, as someone keeps a flower on the Buddha statue of their former house, which is now the city library. It turns out to be none other than Ram.
On finding out his past, Ram's foster parents request him to come back, but he refuses. He then takes them to the railway station, but is nearly ambushed. He succeeds on defeating them and meets Anna, warning him to bring his brother Ajay from Dubai. Soon, he arrives and kills Ramachandran in revenge before challenging Ram to meet him at his brother's place. Ram comes, and after finding out that Anna had Anjali kidnapped, escapes after killing Ajay.

Fracture,crime drama,"Theodore ""Ted"" Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), a wealthy and resourceful Irish aeronautical engineer in Los Angeles, confirms that his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), is having an affair with police detective Robert Nunally (Billy Burke). Confronting his wife, Crawford shoots her. Police are called, including Nunally, who enters the house cautiously, negotiating with Crawford for both to put down their guns. Crawford confesses he shot his wife. Recognizing the victim, and being subtly goaded by Crawford, Nunally becomes enraged and assaults him.
Now in jail awaiting trial, Crawford engages in a battle of wits with rising star deputy district attorney William ""Willy"" Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who considers the case an open-and-shut matter and agrees to go to trial immediately. Beachum is preparing to transition from criminal law to a corporate attorneyship at well-known law firm Wooton & Simms, and flirts with his future boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike).
At the trial, Crawford acts as his own attorney, thereby matching himself, an untrained litigant, against a star prosecutor. Crawford informs the court that the arresting officer (Nunally) was having an affair with his wife, assaulted him during his arrest, and was present during his interrogation. Crawford's confession is therefore ruled inadmissible as evidence, being fruit of the poisonous tree. Beachum discovers that Crawford's handgun could not have been used in the shooting because it does not match shell casings at the crime scene and in fact has never been fired. This baffles police, since CCTV surveillance was in effect during the shooting and until Crawford's arrest.
Nunally comes up with a scheme to plant false evidence to implicate Crawford, which Beachum rejects. With no new evidence to present, Beachum has to concede the trial, and Crawford is acquitted. Disgraced, Nunally commits suicide outside the court.
Beachum's future with the prestigious firm is now in tatters. However, he begins to see his D.A. job as a means to fight for justice for those such as Crawford's wife. Crawford himself observes the change, commenting sarcastically that Beachum has ""found God"". This motivates Beachum to continue searching for evidence, almost obsessively. Realizing that Crawford's plan is to dispose of the only eyewitness to the crime, Beachum obtains a court order to keep Jennifer on life support. He arrives at the hospital, but is unable to prevent staff turning off her life support.
A mix-up of cell phones causes Beachum to realize that Nunally and Crawford both used the same type of gun, a .45 caliber Glock 21. He figures out that before the crime Crawford must have switched his and Nunally's guns in the hotel room where Jennifer and Nunally secretly met. Crawford had shot his wife with Nunally's gun, then reloaded it. The detective had arrived on the scene carrying Crawford's gun, and both had put down their weapons as a preliminary move in negotiations. When Nunally had recognized the victim, rushing over to Jennifer, Crawford had switched the guns again, retrieving his own, unused, weapon. When Crawford had reappeared brandishing his gun, Nunally had tackled and assaulted him, before Crawford's arrest. Nunally had then unwittingly holstered the murder weapon, allowing the unused gun be taken as evidence.
Beachum confronts Crawford with his deductions. With Jennifer now dead, the bullet lodged in her head can now be retrieved and matched with Nunally's gun. Crawford confesses, confident he is protected by the principle of Double Jeopardy. However, Beachum drily informs him that by allowing his wife to die, Crawford can now be prosecuted for murder, having previously been tried merely for attempted murder. Since he had taken Jennifer off life support, new charges can be filed against Crawford and a new trial can be set. Crawford is arrested by waiting police.
The film ends with a new trial about to begin, with Beachum prosecuting and Crawford surrounded by a team of highly paid defense attorneys from Wooton & Simms.",crime drama theodore ted crawford anthony hopkins wealthy resourceful irish aeronautical engineer los angeles confirm wife jennifer embeth davidtz have affair police detective robert nunally billy burke confront wife crawford shoot police call include nunally enter house cautiously negotiate crawford gun crawford confesse shoot wife recognize victim subtly goad crawford nunally enraged assault jail await trial crawford engage battle wit rise star deputy district attorney william willy beachum ryan gosling consider case open shut matter agree trial immediately beachum prepare transition criminal law corporate attorneyship know law firm wooton simms flirt future boss nikki gardner rosamund pike trial crawford act attorney match untrained litigant star prosecutor crawford inform court arrest officer nunally have affair wife assault arrest present interrogation crawford confession rule inadmissible evidence fruit poisonous tree beachum discover crawford handgun shooting match shell casing crime scene fact fire baffle police cctv surveillance effect shooting crawford arrest nunally come scheme plant false evidence implicate crawford beachum reject new evidence present beachum concede trial crawford acquit disgrace nunally commit suicide outside court beachum future prestigious firm tatter begin job means fight justice crawford wife crawford observe change comment sarcastically beachum find god motivate beachum continue search evidence obsessively realize crawford plan dispose eyewitness crime beachum obtain court order jennifer life support arrive hospital unable prevent staff turn life support mix cell phone cause beachum realize nunally crawford type gun caliber glock figure crime crawford switch nunally gun hotel room jennifer nunally secretly meet crawford shoot wife nunally gun reload detective arrive scene carry crawford gun weapon preliminary negotiation nunally recognize victim rush jennifer crawford switch gun retrieve unused weapon crawford reappear brandish gun nunally tackle assault crawford arrest nunally unwittingly holstere murder weapon allow unused gun take evidence beachum confront crawford deduction jennifer dead bullet lodge head retrieve match nunally gun crawford confesse confident protect principle double jeopardy beachum drily inform allow wife die crawford prosecute murder having previously try merely attempt murder take jennifer life support new charge file crawford new trial set crawford arrest wait police film end new trial begin beachum prosecuting crawford surround team highly pay defense attorney wooton simms

Sky West and Crooked,romantic drama,"The film begins with a flashback to when an eight-years-old Brydie White [Hayley Mills] was with a playmate when he accidentally killed himself with a shotgun. Flashing forward, Brydie is a troubled seventeen-year-old girl, living in a small, isolated village in the West Country of England. It becomes apparent that, because they were alone in the churchyard, some of the adults in the village have always been suspicious of what actually happened, especially the father of her playmate whose shotgun killed his son. Their negative feelings and behaviour towards Brydie are compounded by their disapproval of the fact that her mother was not married to her late father. Her mother is a sad and lonely person who is not a good mother to Brydie, and she drinks heavily. A band of gypsies have recently taken up residence near the village, which some of the villagers are not at all pleased about, so, when one of the young gypsies, Roibin Krisenki [Ian McShane], takes a romantic interest in Brydie, emotions begin to run high in both communities.",romantic drama film begin flashback year old brydie white hayley mill playmate accidentally kill shotgun flash forward brydie troubled seventeen year old girl live small isolated village west country england apparent churchyard adult village suspicious actually happen especially father playmate shotgun kill son negative feeling behaviour brydie compound disapproval fact mother married late father mother sad lonely person good mother brydie drink heavily band gypsy recently take residence near village villager pleased young gypsy roibin krisenki ian mcshane take romantic interest brydie emotion begin run high community
Amistad,drama,"La Amistad is the name of a slave ship traveling from Cuba to the United States in 1839. It is carrying African slaves as its cargo. As the ship is crossing from Cuba to the United States, Cinqué, a leader of the Africans, leads a mutiny and takes over the ship. The mutineers spare the lives of two Spanish navigators to help them sail the ship back to Africa. Instead, the navigators misdirect the Africans and sail north to the east coast of the United States, where the ship is stopped by the American Navy, and the living Africans imprisoned as runaway slaves.
In an unfamiliar country and not speaking a single word of English, the Africans find themselves in a legal battle. District Attorney William S. Holabird brings charges of piracy and murder. Secretary of State John Forsyth, on behalf of President Martin Van Buren (who is campaigning for re-election), represents the claim of Queen Isabella II of Spain that the Africans are slaves and are property of Spain based on a treaty. Two Naval officers claim them as salvage while the two Spanish navigators produce proof of purchase. A lawyer named Roger Sherman Baldwin, hired by the abolitionist Lewis Tappan and his black associate Theodore Joadson, decides to defend the Africans.
Baldwin argues that the Africans had been captured in Africa to be sold in the Americas illegally. Baldwin proves through documents found hidden aboard La Amistad that the African people were initially cargo belonging to a Portuguese slave ship, the Tecora. Therefore, the Africans were free citizens of another country and not slaves at all. In light of this evidence, the staff of President Van Buren has the judge presiding over the case replaced by Judge Coglin, who is younger and believed to be impressionable and easily influenced. Consequently, seeking to make the case more personal, on the advice of former American president (and lawyer) John Quincy Adams, Baldwin and Joadson find James Covey, a former slave who speaks both Mende and English. Cinque tells his story at trial: Cinque was kidnapped by slave traders outside his village, and held in the slave fortress of Lomboko, where thousands of captives were held under heavy guard. Cinque and many others were then sold to the Tecora, where they were held in the brig of the ship. The captives were beaten and whipped, and at times, were given so little food that they had to eat the food from each other's faces. One day, 50 captives were thrown overboard. Later on, the ship arrived in Havana, Cuba. Those captives that were not sold at auction were handed over to La Amistad.
District Attorney Holabird attacks Cinqué's ""tale"" of being captured and kept in the slave fortress, and especially questions the throwing of precious cargo overboard. However, the Royal Navy's fervent abolitionist Captain Fitzgerald of the West Africa Squadron backs up Cinqué's account. Baldwin shows from the Tecora's inventory that the number of African people taken as slaves was reduced by 50. Fitzgerald explains that some slave ships when interdicted do this to get rid of the evidence for their crime. But in the Tecora's case, they had underestimated the amount of provisions necessary for their journey. As the tension rises, Cinqué stands up from his seat and repeatedly cries, ""Give us, us free!""
Judge Coglin rules in favor of the Africans. After pressure from Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina on President Van Buren, the case is appealed to the Supreme Court. Despite refusing to help when the case was initially presented, Adams agrees to assist with the case. At the Supreme Court, he makes an impassioned and eloquent plea for their release, and is successful.
The Lomboko slave fortress is liberated by the Royal Marines under the command of Captain Fitzgerald. After all the slaves were hurried out of the fortress, Fitzgerald orders the ship's cannon to destroy it. He then dictates a letter to Forsyth saying that he was right—the slave fortress doesn't exist.
Because of the release of the Africans, Van Buren loses his re-election campaign, and tension builds between the North and the South, which would eventually culminate in the Civil War.",drama la amistad slave ship travel cuba united states carry african slave cargo ship cross cuba united states cinqué leader africans lead mutiny take ship mutineer spare life spanish navigator help sail ship africa instead navigator misdirect african sail north east coast united states ship stop american navy live african imprison runaway slave unfamiliar country speak single word english african find legal battle district attorney william holabird bring charge piracy murder secretary state john forsyth behalf president martin van buren campaign election represent claim queen isabella ii spain african slave property spain base treaty naval officer claim salvage spanish navigator produce proof purchase lawyer name roger sherman baldwin hire abolitionist lewis tappan black associate theodore joadson decide defend african baldwin argue african capture africa sell america illegally baldwin prove document find hide aboard la amistad african people initially cargo belong portuguese slave ship tecora african free citizen country slave light evidence staff president van buren judge preside case replace judge coglin young believe impressionable easily influence consequently seek case personal advice american president lawyer john quincy adams baldwin joadson find james covey slave speak mende english cinque tell story trial cinque kidnap slave trader outside village hold slave fortress lomboko thousand captive hold heavy guard cinque sell tecora hold brig ship captive beat whip time give little food eat food face day captive throw overboard later ship arrive havana cuba captive sell auction hand la amistad district attorney holabird attack cinqué tale capture keep slave fortress especially question throwing precious cargo overboard royal navy fervent abolitionist captain fitzgerald west africa squadron back cinqué account baldwin show tecora inventory number african people take slave reduce fitzgerald explain slave ship interdict rid evidence crime tecora case underestimate provision necessary journey tension rise cinqué stand seat repeatedly cry free judge coglin rule favor african pressure senator john calhoun south carolina president van buren case appeal supreme court despite refuse help case initially present adams agree assist case supreme court make impassioned eloquent plea release successful lomboko slave fortress liberate royal marines command captain fitzgerald slave hurry fortress fitzgerald order ship cannon destroy dictate letter forsyth say right slave fortress exist release african van buren lose election campaign tension build north south eventually culminate civil war
Cleopatra,drama,"After the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, where Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) has defeated Pompey the Great in a brutal civil war for control of the Roman Republic, Pompey flees to Egypt, hoping to enlist the support of the young Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII (Richard O'Sullivan) and his sister Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor). Caesar follows him to Egypt, under the pretext of being named the executor of the will of their father, Ptolemy XII. Much to his dismay, Caesar is given Pompey's head as a gift, as the highly manipulated pharaoh was convinced by his chief eunuch Pothinus (Gregoire Aslan) that this act would endear him to Caesar.
As Caesar stays in one of the palaces, a slave named Apollodorus (Cesare Danova) brings him a gift. When the suspicious Caesar unrolls the rug, he finds Cleopatra herself concealed within. He is intrigued with her beauty and warm personality, and she convinces him to restore her throne from her younger brother.
Soon after, Cleopatra warns Caesar that her brother has surrounded the palace with his soldiers and that he is vastly outnumbered. Counterattacking, he orders the Egyptian fleet burned so he can gain control of the harbor. The fire spreads to the city, destroying the famous Library of Alexandria. Cleopatra angrily confronts Caesar, but he refuses to pull troops away from the fight with Ptolemy's forces to quell the fire. In the middle of their spat, Caesar forcefully kisses her.
The Romans hold, and the armies of Mithridates arrive on Egyptian soil, causing Ptolemy's offensive to collapse. The following day, Caesar is in effective control of the kingdom. He sentences Pothinus to death for arranging an assassination attempt on Cleopatra, and banishes Ptolemy to the eastern desert, where he and his outnumbered army would face certain death against Mithridates. Cleopatra is crowned Queen of Egypt. She begins to develop megalomaniacal dreams of ruling the world with Caesar, who in turn desires to become king of Rome. They marry, and when their son Caesarion is born, Caesar accepts him publicly, which becomes the talk of Rome and the Senate.
After he is made dictator for life, Caesar sends for Cleopatra. She arrives in Rome in a lavish procession and wins the adulation of the Roman people. The Senate grows increasingly discontented amid rumors that Caesar wishes to be made king, which is anathema to the Romans. On the Ides of March in 44 BC, the Senate is preparing to vote on whether to award Caesar additional powers. They assassinate Caesar and split up the empire. Marcus Aemilius Lepidus receives Africa, Octavian (Roddy McDowall) receives Hispania and Gaul, while Mark Antony (Richard Burton) will take control of the eastern provinces. However, the rivalry between Octavian and Antony is becoming apparent. Cleopatra is angered after Caesar's will recognizes his adopted son Octavian instead of Caesarion as his official heir, and angrily returns to Egypt.
While planning a campaign against Parthia in the east, Antony realizes he needs money and supplies, and cannot get enough from anywhere but Egypt. After refusing several times to leave Egypt, Cleopatra gives in and meets him in Tarsus. Antony becomes drunk during a lavish feast. Cleopatra sneaks away, leaving a slave dressed as her, but Antony discovers the trick and confronts the queen.
The war is decided at the naval Battle of Actium on September 2, 31 BC where Octavian's fleet, under the command of Agrippa, defeats the Antony-Egyptian fleet. In the midst of the battle, with Antony's ship on fire, Cleopatra assumes he is dead and orders the Egyptian forces home. Antony follows, leaving his fleet leaderless and soon defeated.
Several months later, Cleopatra manages to convince Antony to retake command of his troops and fight Octavian's advancing army. However, Antony's soldiers have lost faith in him and abandon him during the night; Rufio (Martin Landau), the last man loyal to Antony, kills himself. Antony tries to goad Octavian into single combat, but is finally forced to flee into the city.
Octavian and his army march into Alexandria with Caesarion's dead body in a wagon. Octavian has taken Caesarion's ring, which his mother gave him earlier as a parting gift when she sent him to safety.
When Antony returns to the palace, Apollodorus, not believing that Antony is worthy of his queen, convinces him that she is dead, whereupon Antony falls on his own sword. Apollodorus then confesses that he misled Antony and assists him to the tomb where Cleopatra and two servants have taken refuge. Antony dies of his wounds soon after.
Octavian seizes the palace and discovers the dead body of Apollodorus, who had poisoned himself. Octavian receives word that Antony is dead and Cleopatra is holed up in a tomb. Octavian sees her and after some verbal sparring offers her his word that he will spare her, return her possessions, and allow her to rule Egypt as a Roman province in return for her agreeing to accompany him to Rome. She observes Caesarion's ring on Octavian's hand and inquires after her son. When Octavian denies any knowledge of his whereabouts and pledges to allow him to rule Egypt in his mother's absence, Cleopatra knows her son is dead and that Octavian's word is without value. She agrees to Octavian's terms, including a pledge not to harm herself, sworn on the life of her dead son. After Octavian departs, she orders her servants in coded language to assist with her suicide.
She sends her servant Charmion to give Octavian a letter. In the letter she asks to be buried with Antony. Octavian realizes that she is going to kill herself and he and his guards burst into Cleopatra's chamber and find her dressed in gold, and dead, along with her servant Eiras, while an asp crawls along the floor.
Charmion is found kneeling next to the altar on which Cleopatra is lying, and Agrippa asks of her: ""Was this well done of your lady?"" She replies: ""Extremely well. As befitting the last of so many noble rulers."" She then falls dead as Agrippa watches.",drama battle pharsalus bc julius caesar rex harrison defeat pompey great brutal civil war control roman republic pompey flee egypt hope enlist support young pharaoh ptolemy xiii richard sister cleopatra elizabeth taylor caesar follow egypt pretext name executor father ptolemy xii dismay caesar give pompey head gift highly manipulated pharaoh convince chief eunuch pothinus gregoire aslan act endear caesar caesar stay palace slave name apollodorus cesare danova bring gift suspicious caesar unroll rug find cleopatra conceal intrigue beauty warm personality convince restore throne young brother soon cleopatra warn caesar brother surround palace soldier vastly outnumber counterattack order egyptian fleet burn gain control harbor fire spread city destroy famous library alexandria cleopatra angrily confront caesar refuse pull troop away fight ptolemy force quell fire middle spat caesar forcefully kiss romans hold army mithridate arrive egyptian soil cause ptolemy offensive collapse follow day caesar effective control kingdom sentence pothinus death arrange assassination attempt cleopatra banish ptolemy eastern desert outnumber army face certain death mithridate cleopatra crown queen egypt begin develop megalomaniacal dream rule world caesar turn desire king rome marry son caesarion bear caesar accept publicly talk rome senate dictator life caesar send cleopatra arrive rome lavish procession win adulation roman people senate grows increasingly discontent amid rumor caesar wish king anathema romans ide march bc senate prepare vote award caesar additional power assassinate caesar split empire marcus aemilius lepidus receive africa octavian roddy mcdowall receive hispania gaul mark antony richard burton control eastern province rivalry octavian antony apparent cleopatra anger caesar recognize adopt son octavian instead caesarion official heir angrily return egypt plan campaign parthia east antony realize need money supply egypt refuse time leave egypt cleopatra give meet tarsus antony drunk lavish feast cleopatra sneak away leave slave dress antony discover trick confront queen war decide naval battle actium september bc octavian fleet command agrippa defeat antony egyptian fleet midst battle antony ship fire cleopatra assume dead order egyptian force home antony follow leave fleet leaderless soon defeat month later cleopatra manage convince antony retake command troop fight octavian advance army antony soldier lose faith abandon night rufio martin landau man loyal antony kill antony try goad octavian single combat finally force flee city octavian army march alexandria caesarion dead body wagon octavian take caesarion ring mother give early parting gift send safety antony return palace apollodorus believe antony worthy queen convince dead antony fall sword apollodorus confess mislead antony assist tomb cleopatra servant take refuge antony die wound soon octavian seize palace discover dead body apollodorus poison octavian receive word antony dead cleopatra hole tomb octavian see verbal sparring offer word spare return possession allow rule egypt roman province return agree accompany rome observe caesarion ring octavian hand inquire son octavian deny knowledge whereabouts pledge allow rule egypt mother absence cleopatra know son dead octavian word value agree octavian term include pledge harm swear life dead son octavian depart order servant code language assist suicide send servant charmion octavian letter letter ask bury antony octavian realize go kill guard burst cleopatra chamber find dress gold dead servant eira asp crawl floor charmion find kneel altar cleopatra lie agrippa ask lady reply extremely befit noble ruler fall dead agrippa watch

The Watch,sci-fi comedy,"In the town of Glenview, Ohio, Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is a passionate volunteer in the community and senior manager of the local Costco store. His life is changed when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and overprotective father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcé.
The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and relax, much to Evan's chagrin. While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly destructive weapon and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan seemingly kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch members theorize that the aliens are stealing their victims' skins and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty) and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and reveals his worry that it may cause her to dump him.
Evan suspects that one of his neighbors is an alien due to his deadpan, cryptic way of speaking and because he always seems to be following Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out together.
Evan then receives an urgent visit from Jamarcus, who confesses that he is one of the aliens but has chosen to side with humanity after experiencing human culture. He warns the group that the aliens are building a transmitter beneath the Costco store which will summon their armada to destroy the earth; he is expelled from the watch for his deception. Bob, Franklin, Evan, and Abby arm themselves and infiltrate the Costco to destroy the transmitter. Bob encounters Jason who reveals that he is also an alien, and they brawl. Evan and Franklin attempt to disable the transmitter, but are surrounded by aliens. Jamarcus arrives and saves the pair, revealing that the aliens' brains are located in their crotch; Bob kills Jason by ripping off his penis. Evan discovers that the transmitter is powered by the metallic orb and removes it, disabling the machine. More aliens arrive, forcing the group to flee. The watch uses the metallic orb to destroy the Costco building, killing all of the aliens inside.
In the epilogue, Evan and Abby rekindle their romance and adopt a daughter. Bob is closer to Chelsea and likes her new boyfriend, who is scared by stories of how Bob killed Jason by ""ripping his dick off"". Franklin is finally accepted by the Glenview Police Department, and Jamarcus continues participating in the secret neighborhood orgies.

Willy McBean and his Magic Machine,animation,"Willy McBean is sick of trying to learn history for school. Meanwhile, an evil scientist called Rasputin Von Rotten is building a magical time machine so he can go back in time and be the most famous person in history. A Spanish-English talking monkey named Pablo climbs through Willy's window. He explains that he escaped from Von Rotten and he tells Willy what he is planning to do. Pablo stole the plans to the time machine.
Willy builds his own machine to go back in time to stop Von Rotten. The machine isn't working properly. They end up with General George Armstrong Custer (1839–1876), and escape moments before Custer is killed.
They then arrive in the Wild West, where they meet Buffalo Bill Cody and his Indian pal, Sitting Bull. Von Rotten plans to become the fastest gun in the west. Von Rotten asks Bill for a showdown, but both guns are sabotaged before anyone can be shot.
Von Rotten moves onto his next target, Christopher Columbus. Once there, disguised as a Chinese trader, he convinces Columbus's crew that they should mutiny. Once more McBean and Pablo stop the evil professor by showing the crew that land is not far off.
After that, Von Rotten goes back to England in the days of King Arthur in the kingdom of Camelot, but Pablo and Willy get Arthur to pull Excalibur the magic sword that can talk. A talking green dragon then crashes into Camelot in an effort to eat everyone, but King Arthur and Excalibur are able to drive him away.
Willy and Pablo later go to Ancient Egypt to stop Von Rotten from building the Great Pyramid, but the duo reach Ancient Rome on the way. Then they go back to prehistoric times to encourage cavemen to invent fire and the wheel before Von Rotten.

Gulliver's Travels,"comedy, family","Deeply depressed at his dead-end job in the mail room of a New York City newspaper, Lemuel Gulliver decides to talk to journalist Darcy Silverman. He convinces her he could write a report about his (false) extensive world ""travels"" saying his dream is to become a writer. After suffering writer's block and thinking that Darcy will not want to hang out with a ""guy from the mailroom"", he plagiarises a report from other publications on the internet. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task – to travel to the Bermuda Triangle and write an article about the legends of ships mysteriously disappearing there.
Upon arrival in Bermuda, Gulliver rents a boat and travels into the triangle. After falling asleep at the helm of his ship, he's caught in a freak storm and the boat is overwhelmed by a waterspout. He washes up unconscious on the shore of Lilliput, where he is immediately confirmed as a ""beast"" by the town's tiny people. After the citizens claim him to be dangerous because of his huge size, he is captured and imprisoned in a cave. Here, he meets another prisoner named Horatio who was jailed by General Edward because he loves Princess Mary of Lilliput, whereas Edward also wants her. After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscia, infiltrates commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped. Gulliver also saves her father, King Theodore from a fire by urinating on it.
Gulliver is declared a hero by Lilliput's citizens and makes up a deal of lies saying he is the President of Manhattan, says Yoda is his Vice-President and a living legend in his homeland. Edward, however, becomes enraged due to the luxurious accommodations that have been built for him, and even being presented as an honorary general of the Lilliputian Army complete with uniform. When the townspeople find Gulliver's boat and his things, Gulliver gets angry voicemails from Darcy, saying she has to take his place and travel to Bermuda now, and also found out about his plagiarism and now hates him. The next day, chaos ensues as the Blefuscian Navy lay siege on the city when Edward shuts down its defense system as an act of revenge for Gulliver's treatment. Gulliver defeats the armada, invulnerable to the cannonballs being fired at him (although he receives numerous welts on his stomach). Embarrassed once more, and with Mary no longer wanting to do anything with him, Edward defects to the Blefuscians and brings with him blueprints of a robot coming from Gulliver's Guitar Hero III game manual. The Blefuscians secretly build the robot, with Edward as the pilot.
The Blefuscians invade Liliput and the robot-wielding Edward makes Gulliver admit to the people that he is ""just the guy from the mail-room"" and nothing more. Edward banishes Gulliver on the shores of ""the island where we dare not go"" (Brobdingnag). There, he is snatched up by a ""little"" girl (Glumdalclitch) who towers over him. She captures him easily by trapping him inside a glass cup. When Gulliver wakes up, he finds himself dressed up in a pink dress and is played with by the ""little"" girl, which ends with him being tucked in bed. Horatio, who has gone to find Gulliver after being spurned by Mary, reveals to Gulliver that Darcy has been imprisoned by the Blefuscians when she is lost in the Bermuda Triangle in the same manner as Gulliver. Gulliver narrowly escapes with him, using a parachute that he took from a dead U.S. Air Force pilot sitting in the dollhouse.
Once again accepting a duel from Edward, this time not only for Lilliput's freedom but for its fate as well – as Edward threatens to destroy it should Gulliver fail – Gulliver ultimately defeats him with the assistance of Horatio, who disables the machine's electrocuting weapon. Horatio is hailed a hero and gets King Theodore's permission to court the princess.

The Bachelor,romantic comedy,"Jimmie Shannon (Chris O'Donnell) wants to be a bachelor forever: a wild 'Mustang', free and never tied down. Eventually though, after three years he proposes to his girlfriend Anne (Renée Zellweger), in the most romantic restaurant in town—only he spoils the special occasion with a very crude approach. Anne is going to Greece for an assignment when Jimmie discovers his crazy and heavily grouchy grandfather James Shannon (Peter Ustinov) has died and left him the family business that Pool table company called Shannon Billaeds, all his assets, and $100 million. But Jimmie can only have it if he is married by 6:05 p.m. on his 30th birthday, which happens to be the next day. A couple of rules is that he and his bride to bride to be one should not be one week apart and they have to be married for 10 years and tried to have a kid in five years to keep the 100 million dollars. He, his friend Marco (Artie Lange), and his grandfather's two friends and colleagues (Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook) must find a bride in the next few hours. With a priest (James Cromwell) in tow, they begin.
Jimmie proposes to Anne again, but she is able to see his core reticence, and leaves for Greece. Jimmie, unable to give up inheriting the money due to the lives that would be ruined if the family business closes, decides to pursue ex-girlfriends to propose to. If Jimmy doesn't get the 100 million dollars, their competitor Oden Sports will buy the company and take over. That company will shut down Shannon Billards in a week. Meanwhile, Anne has second thoughts and returns to her apartment, which she shares with her sister Natalie (Marley Shelton). Natalie talks Anne into going home to go visit their parents in Napa for the night.
Jimmie, on his desperate quest, opens a shoebox full of photos of old girlfriends, and begins to track them down one by one. First he sees Stacey (Rebecca Cross), an oil futures trader, who, as it turns out, is engaged already. Second is Zoe (Stacy Edwards), a clingy window dresser. When Jimmie goes to see her, just after promising he'd never leave her for another woman, he runs off after a woman in the street whom he thinks is Anne (which turns out not to be). He returns to find Zoe has set a mannequin on fire in effigy of him. He also strikes out with a melodramatic opera singer (Mariah Carey) and a tough-as-nails cop (Jennifer Esposito). Soon his list is depleted, but his last choice accepts— brittle, chain-smoking socialite Buckley (Brooke Shields), who detests Jimmie but wants his money to prop up her waning family fortune. As the priest tries to conduct the ceremony, she gradually learns the other conditions of the will: she and Jimmie must have children within five years, spend no more than one night apart per month, and need to stay married for at least ten years. Horrified, she drives off in a convertible.
Anne misses Jimmie and heads back to the city. Trying to locate Jimmie, she calls Marco to arrange dinner with Jimmie. Desperate, Marco had earlier placed an ad for a bride in the newspaper. He figures a few women will show up at the appointed time and church for the offer.
As everyone scrambles to help Jimmie save the family business, Jimmie realizes the ""effect"" of marriage, as the kindly priest reveals how he took on the priesthood after his beloved wife died, and that he was proud to be married and produce a wonderful family in the process.
Realizing that he truly loves Anne and is ready to 'take the plunge', Jimmie, after being up all night, rests in the church where Marco had promised to deliver a bride. He awakens to find hundreds of women dressed as brides waiting for him. After trying to settle the women down, Marco lies and says it was all a prank. This angers them, and they try to rip the two men to shreds. Marco reveals that Anne is on her way back, so Jimmie flees to the train station, ordering a cake on the way. He makes it there after being chased by hundreds of 'brides'. He finds Anne in the train, but she has discovered a newspaper with its front page asking, ""Would you marry this man for $100 million?"" with Jimmie's picture beside. She is upset, but he professes his love for her and they reconcile.
Natalie finds a discarded wedding dress in the station, and Anne puts it on in the bathroom. She opens the door to see hundreds of would-be brides run past, chasing Jimmie. Jimmie flees through the streets of San Francisco. He eventually climbs up a flight on a fire escape ladder and shouts for Anne, as the would-be brides gather en masse below. The priest begins to conducts the ceremony over a loudspeaker from inside a police car, causing many 'brides' to attack the car, and chaos ensues. Anne, in the crowd, makes her way through and up to Jimmie. Natalie yells at everybody to ""Shut up!"". Anne convinces the other women to be happy and let it be her day.
The priest finishes the ceremony by pronouncing them husband and wife, to cheers from all, and Jimmie and Anne kiss. They made it just in time before the deadline of 6:05 p.m. to inherit a 100 million dollars. She then tosses her bouquet into the teeming crowd below.",romantic comedy jimmie shannon chris want bachelor forever wild mustang free tie eventually year propose girlfriend anne renée zellweger romantic restaurant town spoil special occasion crude approach anne go greece assignment jimmie discover crazy heavily grouchy grandfather james shannon peter ustinov die leave family business pool table company call shannon billaeds asset million jimmie marry birthday happen day couple rule bride bride week apart marry year try kid year million dollar friend marco artie lange grandfather friend colleague ed asner hal holbrook find bride hour priest james cromwell tow begin jimmie propose anne able core reticence leave greece jimmie unable inherit money life ruin family business close decide pursue ex girlfriend propose jimmy million dollar competitor oden sport buy company company shut shannon billard week anne second thought return apartment share sister natalie marley shelton natalie talks anne go home visit parent napa night jimmie desperate quest open shoebox photo old girlfriend begin track see stacey rebecca cross oil future trader turn engage second zoe stacy edward clingy window dresser jimmie go promise leave woman run woman street think anne turn return find zoe set mannequin fire effigy strike melodramatic opera singer mariah carey tough nail cop jennifer esposito soon list deplete choice accept brittle chain smoke socialite buckley brooke shields detest jimmie want money prop wane family fortune priest try conduct ceremony gradually learn condition jimmie child year spend night apart month need stay married year horrify drive convertible anne miss jimmie head city try locate jimmie call marco arrange dinner jimmie desperate marco early place ad bride newspaper figure woman appoint time church offer scramble help jimmie save family business jimmie realize effect marriage kindly priest reveal take priesthood beloved wife die proud marry produce wonderful family process realize truly love anne ready plunge jimmie night rest church marco promise deliver bride awaken find hundred woman dress bride wait try settle woman marco lie say prank anger try rip man shred marco reveal anne way jimmie flee train station order cake way make chase hundred bride find anne train discover newspaper page ask marry man million jimmie picture upset profess love reconcile natalie find discard wedding dress station anne put bathroom open door hundred bride run past chase jimmie jimmie flee street san francisco eventually climb flight fire escape ladder shout anne bride gather en masse priest begin conduct ceremony loudspeaker inside police car cause bride attack car chaos ensue anne crowd make way jimmie natalie yell everybody shut anne convince woman happy let day priest finish ceremony pronounce husband wife cheer jimmie anne kiss time deadline inherit million dollar toss bouquet teem crowd
Kind Hearts and Coronets,black comedy,"In Edwardian England, Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, 10th Duke of Chalfont, is in prison, awaiting his hanging for murder the following morning. As he writes his memoirs, the events of his life are shown in flashback.
His mother, the youngest daughter of the 7th Duke of Chalfont, eloped with an Italian opera singer named Mazzini and was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her station. The Mazzinis were poor but happy until Mazzini died shortly after Louis, his son, had been born. In the aftermath, Louis' widowed mother raises him on the history of her family and tells him how, unlike other aristocratic titles, the dukedom of Chalfont can descend through female heirs. Louis' only childhood friends are Sibella and her brother, the children of a local doctor.
When Louis leaves school, his mother writes to her kinsman Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, a private banker, for assistance in launching her son's career, but is rebuffed. Louis is forced to work as an assistant in a draper's shop. When his mother dies, her last request, to be interred in the family vault at Chalfont Castle, is denied. Then Sibella ridicules Louis' marriage proposal. Instead, she marries Lionel Holland, a former schoolmate with a rich father. Soon after, Louis quarrels with customer Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, the banker's only child, who has him dismissed from his job.
Louis resolves to kill Ascoyne D'Ascoyne and the other seven people ahead of him in succession to the dukedom. After arranging a fatal boating accident for Ascoyne D'Ascoyne and his mistress, Louis writes a letter of condolence to his victim's father, Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, who employs him as a clerk. Upon his later promotion, Louis takes a bachelor flat in St James's, London, for assignations with Sibella.
Louis then targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is charmed by his wife, Edith. He substitutes petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is fit to be his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Anglican Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons his after-dinner port. From the window of his flat, Louis then uses a bow and arrow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of caviar which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, he conveniently insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea.
When Edith agrees to marry Louis, they notify Ethelred, the childless, widowed 8th Duke. He invites them to spend a few days at Chalfont Castle. When Ethelred casually informs Louis that he intends to remarry in order to produce an heir, Louis arranges a hunting ""accident"". Before murdering the Duke, he reveals his motive. Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne dies from the shock of learning that he has become the ninth duke, sparing Louis from murdering his kindly employer. Louis inherits the title, but his triumph proves short-lived. A Scotland Yard detective arrests him on suspicion of having murdered Lionel, who was found dead following Louis's rejection of his drunken plea for help to avoid bankruptcy.
Louis elects to be tried by his peers in the House of Lords. During the trial, Louis and Edith are married. Sibella falsely testifies that Lionel was about to seek a divorce and name Louis as co-respondent. Ironically, Louis is convicted for a murder he had never even contemplated.
Louis is visited by Sibella, who observes that the discovery of Lionel's suicide note and Edith's death would free Louis and enable them to marry, a proposal to which he agrees. Moments before his hanging, the discovery of the suicide note saves him. Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him outside the prison. When a reporter tells him that Tit-Bits magazine wishes to publish his memoirs, Louis suddenly remembers that he left his detailed confession in his cell.",black comedy edwardian england louis mazzini duke chalfont prison await hanging murder follow morning write memoir event life show flashback mother young daughter duke chalfont elope italian opera singer name mazzini disown family marry beneath station mazzinis poor happy mazzini die shortly louis son bear aftermath louis widow mother raise history family tell unlike aristocratic title dukedom chalfont descend female heir louis childhood friend sibella brother child local doctor louis leave school mother write kinsman lord ascoyne private banker assistance launch son career rebuff louis force work assistant draper shop mother die request inter family vault chalfont castle deny sibella ridicule louis marriage proposal instead marry lionel holland schoolmate rich father soon louis quarrel customer ascoyne banker child dismiss job louis resolve kill ascoyne seven people ahead succession dukedom arrange fatal boat accident ascoyne mistress louis write letter condolence victim father lord ascoyne employ clerk later promotion louis take bachelor flat st james london assignation sibella louis target henry keen amateur photographer meet henry charm wife edith substitute petrol paraffin lamp henry darkroom fatal result louis decide widow fit duchess reverend lord henry victim pose anglican bishop matabeleland louis poison dinner port window flat louis use bow arrow shoot balloon suffragette lady agatha drop leaflet london louis send general lord rufus jar caviar contain bomb admiral lord horatio present challenge rarely set foot land conveniently insist go ship cause collision sea edith agree marry louis notify ethelre childless widow duke invite spend day chalfont castle ethelre casually inform louis intend remarry order produce heir louis arrange hunting accident murder duke reveal motive lord ascoyne die shock learn ninth duke spare louis murder kindly employer louis inherit title triumph prove short lived scotland yard detective arrest suspicion having murder lionel find dead follow louis rejection drunken plea help avoid bankruptcy louis elect try peer house lords trial louis edith married sibella falsely testify lionel seek divorce louis co respondent ironically louis convict murder contemplate louis visit sibella observe discovery lionel suicide note edith death free louis enable marry proposal agree moment hanging discovery suicide note save louis find edith sibella wait outside prison reporter tell tit bit magazine wish publish memoir louis suddenly remember leave detailed confession cell

The Last Chase,sci-fi drama,"In the year 2011, the United States is a police state. A substantial percentage of the population was wiped out by a devastating viral pandemic twenty years previously. Amidst the resulting chaos and general panic, democracy collapsed and a totalitarian cabal seized power. After moving the seat of government to Boston, the new dictatorship outlawed ownership and use of all automobiles, boats, and aircraft, on the pretext (later proven false) that an even bigger crisis, the exhaustion of fossil fuel supplies, was imminent. The loss of other personal freedoms followed, and surveillance cameras now monitor private citizens' every move.
In Boston, Franklyn Hart (Majors), a former race car driver who lost his family to the plague, is a spokesman for the mass transit system. Publicly, he deplores the selfishness of private vehicle ownership and exalts the virtues of public transportation; privately, he is barely able to contain his contempt for the oppressive, autocratic bureaucracy and the dismal party line that he is compelled to promote.
Years before, as private vehicles were being confiscated, Hart sequestered his race car—an orange Porsche roadster—in a secret compartment beneath his basement. Over the ensuing years he has gradually restored it to drivable condition, raiding long-abandoned junkyards in the dead of night for parts. His goal is to drive across the country to ""Free California"", an independent territory that has broken away from the rest of totalitarian America. Young electronics whiz Ring McCarthy (Makepeace) deduces Hart's plan, and Hart reluctantly agrees to bring him along on his perilous journey.
The ubiquitous surveillance system catches Hart vaulting a junkyard fence; Hart and McCarthy flee Boston in the roadster as police close in. Although gasoline has not been sold for twenty years, Hart has access to a virtually inexhaustible supply, the few inches of residual fuel remaining at the bottom of subterranean storage tanks in every abandoned gas station in the country. He uses a portable hand pump to refuel from these tanks as necessary.
News of the duo's daring adventure spreads across the country. The government—represented by a Gestapo-like figure named Hawkins (George Touliatos)—watches with growing concern as the public takes notice and cheers Hart's defiance of authority. Calls for a return to personal autonomy and democracy are heard, for the first time in two decades. Hart must be stopped; but ground pursuit is impossible, because there are no functional road vehicles capable of chasing down a race car. (Police cars are basically electric golf carts.)
Hawkins orders J.G. Williams (Meredith), a retired Air Force pilot, to track down and destroy Hart and his car in a Korean War-vintage F-86 Sabre jet. He locates and strafes the car, wounding Hart. A community of armed rebels takes Hart and McCarthy in, hides the car, and treats Hart's wounds; but a team of mercenaries soon locates and attacks the enclave. Hart and McCarthy escape during the firefight.
Back on the open road, Williams once again has the roadster in his crosshairs; but now he is having second thoughts. As an old rebel himself, he is starting to identify with Hart's situation. Prodded by Hawkins, Williams initiates several more confrontations, but each time he backs off, to Hart's and McCarthy's bewilderment. McCarthy rigs a radio receiver and listens in on Williams's cockpit radio communications, then establishes a dialog with him using Morse code via a hand-held spotlight. Eventually Williams confides that he is sympathetic to their cause.
But Hawkins is also monitoring Williams's radio communications, and after learning of his change of heart, orders the activation of a Cold War-era laser cannon at a position ahead of Hart's route. Williams attempts to warn Hart, but his radio communications have been jammed. Williams releases his external fuel tanks ahead of the car, hoping the inferno will stop the car short of the cannon's range; but Hart, assuming Williams has changed allegiances yet again, drives on. Williams strafes the laser, but cannot pierce its heavy armor; so he sacrifices himself in a kamikaze-style attack, destroying his jet and the laser installation, and allowing Hart and McCarthy to drive on toward California where they are welcomed as heroes.",sci fi drama year united states police state substantial percentage population wipe devastating viral pandemic year previously amidst result chaos general panic democracy collapse totalitarian cabal seize power move seat government boston new dictatorship outlaw ownership use automobile boat aircraft pretext later prove false big crisis exhaustion fossil fuel supply imminent loss personal freedom follow surveillance camera monitor private citizen boston franklyn hart majors race car driver lose family plague spokesman mass transit system publicly deplore selfishness private vehicle ownership exalt virtue public transportation privately barely able contain contempt oppressive autocratic bureaucracy dismal party line compel promote year private vehicle confiscate hart sequester race car orange porsche roadster secret compartment beneath basement ensue year gradually restore drivable condition raid long abandon junkyard dead night part goal drive country free california independent territory break away rest totalitarian america young electronic whiz ring mccarthy makepeace deduce hart plan hart reluctantly agree bring perilous journey ubiquitous surveillance system catch hart vault junkyard fence hart mccarthy flee boston roadster police close gasoline sell year hart access virtually inexhaustible supply inch residual fuel remain subterranean storage tank abandon gas station country use portable hand pump refuel tank necessary news duo dare adventure spread country government represent gestapo like figure name hawkin george grow concern public take notice cheer hart defiance authority call return personal autonomy democracy hear time decade hart stop ground pursuit impossible functional road vehicle capable chase race car police car basically electric golf cart hawkins orders williams meredith retire air force pilot track destroy hart car korean war vintage sabre jet locate strafe car wound hart community armed rebel take hart mccarthy hide car treat hart wound team mercenary soon locate attack enclave hart mccarthy escape firefight open road williams roadster crosshair have second thought old rebel start identify hart situation prod hawkin williams initiate confrontation time back hart mccarthy bewilderment mccarthy rig radio receiver listen williams cockpit radio communication establish dialog morse code hand hold spotlight eventually williams confide sympathetic cause hawkin monitor williams radio communication learn change heart order activation cold war era laser cannon position ahead hart route williams attempt warn hart radio communication jam williams release external fuel tank ahead car hope inferno stop car short cannon range hart assume williams change allegiance drive williams strafe laser pierce heavy armor sacrifice kamikaze style attack destroy jet laser installation allow hart mccarthy drive california welcome hero

Halloween,horror,"In 1963, on Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael Myers, dressed in a clown costume and mask, inexplicably stabs his older sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife in their home. He is subsequently hospitalized at Warren County's Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, Michael's child psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis, and his colleague, Marion Chambers, arrive at Smith's Grove Sanitarium to take Michael to court. Michael escapes from the sanitarium, stealing Loomis’ car. Returning home to Haddonfield, Michael kills a mechanic for his uniform and steals a white mask, a couple of knives, and some rope from a local store.
The next day, on Halloween, Michael stalks high school student Laurie Strode after she and Tommy Doyle drop off a key at his former house, so her father can sell it. Throughout the day, Laurie notices Michael following her, but her friends Annie Brackett and Lynda Van der Klok dismiss her concerns. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield in search of Michael, knowing his intentions. After discovering that Judith Myers' headstone has been stolen from the local cemetery, Loomis meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett. The two begin their search at Michael's house, where Loomis tries to warn the skeptical sheriff about the danger Michael poses, explaining that Michael is pure evil and capable of further violence, despite years of catatonia. Sheriff Brackett patrols the streets while Loomis waits and watches the house, expecting Michael to return there.
Later that night, Laurie goes over to babysit Tommy, while Annie babysits Lindsey Wallace just across the street, unaware that Michael is watching them. When Annie's boyfriend, Paul, calls her to come and pick him up, she takes Lindsey over to the Doyle house to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy. Annie is just about to leave in her car when Michael, who stowed away in the back seat, strangles her before slitting her throat, killing her.
Soon after, Lynda and her boyfriend Bob Simms arrive at the Wallace house. After having sex, Bob goes downstairs to get a beer for Lynda, but Michael stabs him with a knife which pins him to the wall, killing him. Michael then poses as Bob in a ghost costume and confronts Lynda, who teases him, having no effect. Lynda calls Laurie; just as Laurie picks up, Michael strangles Lynda to death with the telephone cord. Meanwhile, Loomis discovers the stolen car and begins combing the streets.
A suspicious Laurie goes over to the Wallace house. There, she finds the corpses of Annie, Bob, and Lynda in an upstairs bedroom, as well as Judith Myers' headstone.[11] Horrified, Laurie cowers in the hallway, when Michael suddenly appears and attacks her, slashing her arm. Barely escaping, Laurie races back to the Doyle house. Michael gets in and attacks her again, but Laurie manages to fend him off long enough for Tommy and Lindsey to escape. Loomis sees the two children fleeing the house, and goes to investigate, finding Michael and Laurie fighting upstairs. Loomis shoots Michael six times, knocking him off the balcony; when Loomis goes to check Michael's body, he finds it missing. Unsurprised, Loomis stares off into the night. Places where Michael had previously been are shown as his breathing is heard, indicating he could be anywhere, and the last view is of the Myers house.",horror halloween night haddonfield illinois michael myers dress clown costume mask inexplicably stab old sister judith death kitchen knife home subsequently hospitalize warren county smith grove sanitarium year later october michael child psychiatrist dr sam loomis colleague marion chamber arrive smith grove sanitarium michael court michael escape sanitarium steal loomis car return home haddonfield michael kill mechanic uniform steal white mask couple knife rope local store day halloween michael stalk high school student laurie strode tommy doyle drop key house father sell day laurie notice michael follow friend annie brackett lynda van der klok dismiss concern loomis arrive haddonfield search michael know intention discover judith myers headstone steal local cemetery loomis meet annie father sheriff leigh brackett begin search michael house loomis try warn skeptical sheriff danger michael pose explain michael pure evil capable violence despite year catatonia sheriff brackett patrol street loomis wait watch house expect michael return later night laurie go babysit tommy annie babysits lindsey wallace street unaware michael watch annie boyfriend paul call come pick take lindsey doyle house spend night laurie tommy annie leave car michael stow away seat strangle slit throat kill soon lynda boyfriend bob simms arrive wallace house have sex bob go downstairs beer lynda michael stab knife pin wall kill michael pose bob ghost costume confront lynda tease have effect lynda call laurie laurie pick michael strangle lynda death telephone cord loomis discover steal car begin comb street suspicious laurie go wallace house find corpse annie bob lynda upstairs bedroom judith myers horrify laurie cower hallway michael suddenly appear attack slash arm barely escape laurie race doyle house michael get attack laurie manage fend long tommy lindsey escape loomis see child flee house go investigate find michael laurie fight upstairs loomis shoots michael time knock balcony loomis go check michael body find miss unsurprised loomis stare night place michael previously show breathing hear indicate view myers house

Saving Private Ryan,"drama, war","An elderly veteran visits the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial with his family. Upon seeing one particular grave, he falls to his knees overcome with emotion. The scene then shifts to the morning of June 6, 1944, as American soldiers land on Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy Invasion. They suffer heavy losses in assaulting German defensive positions of artillery and machine guns raining down intense fire on the American forces. Captain John H. Miller of the 2nd Ranger Battalion assembles a group to penetrate the German defenses, leading to a breakout from the beach. Elsewhere on the beach, a dead soldier lies face-down in the bloody surf; his pack is stenciled Ryan, S.
In Washington, D.C., at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall learns that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were killed in action and that the fourth son, James, has been parachuted somewhere over Normandy but is currently unable to be located. He is also informed that their mother will receive all three telegrams notifying her of her three sons' deaths on the same day. After reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter aloud for his staff, he orders that James Ryan be found and returned home immediately.
Three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back from the front. He assembles six men from his company—T/Sgt. Mike Horvath, Privates First Class Richard Reiben and Adrian Caparzo, Privates Stanley Mellish and Danny Jackson, medic Irwin Wade—plus T/5 Timothy Upham, a cartographer and interpreter borrowed from another unit. They move out to Neuville, where they meet a squad from the 101st Airborne Division, where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper, quickly taken out by Jackson. They locate a Private James Ryan but quickly learn he is not their man. They eventually encounter a friend of James Ryan, who tells them that he is defending an important bridge in the town of Ramelle.
On the way to Ramelle, Miller decides to neutralize a German machine gun position at a derelict radar station, despite his men's misgivings; Wade is killed in the skirmish. Miller, at Upham's urging, declines to execute a surviving German soldier (nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie"") and sets him free on the condition that he surrender to the first Allied unit he encounters. Losing confidence in Miller's leadership, Reiben declares his intention to desert, prompting a confrontation with Horvath, which Miller defuses by disclosing his civilian background as a teacher, about which his men had set up a betting pool. Reiben reluctantly decides to stay.
Outside Ramelle, Miller and the squad encounters a German half-track with troops and ambush them together with three paratroopers, one of whom is Ryan. In the town, Miller's squad find a small group of paratroopers preparing to defend the key bridge, and where Miller tells Ryan about his brothers and their orders to bring him home, with two of his men having been lost in finding him. He is distressed at the loss of his brothers, but asks Miller to tell his mother that he intends to stay ""with the only brothers [he has] left."" Miller decides to join his unit with the paratroopers in defense of the bridge against the imminent German attack. Miller forms ambush positions throughout the ruined town, preparing to attack arriving tanks and infantry with mines, Molotov cocktails, detonation cords and ""sticky bombs"" made from socks filled with Composition B smeared with thick grease.
Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division arrive with infantry and armor, comprising two Tiger I tanks and two Marder tank destroyers/light assault guns. Although they managed to inflict heavy casualties on the Germans, including destroying one Tiger tank and both Marders, most of the paratroopers, along with Jackson, Mellish and Horvath are killed, while Upham avoids fighting due to his jittery nerves and hides himself from his German foes. Miller attempts to blow up the bridge, but is shot and mortally wounded by Steamboat Willie, who had somehow rejoined the Germans. In confusion and supposed desperation after suffering intense German fire, Miller crawls to the middle of the bridge and attempts to open fire on the oncoming German tank and accompanying troops with his pistol. Just before the last Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Witnessing Miller's shooting, Upham leaps out from his hiding and confronts Steamboat Willie and his group as they attempt to retreat. Steamboat Willie raises his hands in surrender and smiles, believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Instead, Upham kills him, but lets the other Germans flee.
Reiben and Ryan are with Miller as he dies and utters his last words, ""James...earn this. Earn it.""
The elderly veteran is revealed to be Ryan and the grave he is standing at is Miller’s. Ryan expresses his appreciation for what Miller and the others did for him. He then asks his wife if he is a ""good man"" worthy of their sacrifices, to which she tells him he is. Ryan comes to attention and salutes Miller's grave.",drama war elderly veteran visit normandy american cemetery memorial family see particular grave fall knee overcome emotion scene shift morning june american soldier land omaha beach normandy invasion suffer heavy loss assault german defensive position artillery machine gun rain intense fire american force captain john miller ranger battalion assemble group penetrate german defense lead breakout beach beach dead soldier lie face bloody surf pack stencil ryan washington war department general george marshall learn brother ryan family kill action fourth son james parachute normandy currently unable locate inform mother receive telegram notify son death day read abraham lincoln bixby letter aloud staff order james ryan find return home immediately day d day miller receive order find ryan bring assemble man company t sgt mike horvath private class richard reiben adrian caparzo private stanley mellish danny jackson medic irwin wade plus timothy upham cartographer interpreter borrow unit neuville meet squad airborne division caparzo kill german sniper quickly take jackson locate private james ryan quickly learn man eventually encounter friend james ryan tell defend important bridge town ramelle way ramelle miller decide neutralize german machine gun position derelict radar station despite man misgiving wade kill skirmish miller upham urging decline execute survive german soldier nickname steamboat willie set free condition surrender ally unit encounter lose confidence miller leadership reiben declare intention desert prompt confrontation horvath miller defuse disclose civilian background teacher man set bet pool reiben reluctantly decide stay outside ramelle miller squad encounter german half track troop ambush paratrooper ryan town miller squad find small group paratrooper prepare defend key bridge miller tell ryan brother order bring home man having lose find distressed loss brother ask miller tell mother intend stay brother leave miller decide join unit paratrooper defense bridge imminent german attack miller form ambush position ruin town prepare attack arrive tank infantry mine molotov cocktail detonation cord sticky bomb sock fill composition b smear thick grease element ss panzer division arrive infantry armor comprise tiger tank marder tank destroyer light assault gun manage inflict heavy casualty german include destroy tiger tank marder paratrooper jackson mellish horvath kill upham avoid fighting jittery nerve hide german foe miller attempt blow bridge shoot mortally wound steamboat willie rejoin german confusion suppose desperation suffer intense german fire miller crawl middle bridge attempt open fire oncoming german tank accompany troop pistol tiger tank reach bridge american mustang fly overhead destroy tank follow american armored unit rout remain german witness miller shooting upham leap hiding confront steamboat willie group attempt retreat steamboat willie raise hand surrender smile believe upham accept early encounter instead upham kill let germans flee reiben ryan miller die utter word james earn earn elderly veteran reveal ryan grave stand miller ryan express appreciation miller ask wife good man worthy sacrifice tell ryan come attention salute miller grave

Hare Ram,action/drama,"The film is about an IPS officer Hari (Kalyan Ram) who is busy investigating the murders of a news reporter (Prabhakar) and a well known doctor GK Reddy (Rajeev Kanakala) and then discovers that these are the murders done by his twin Ram (also Kalyan Ram).
The story goes that Ram has a problem with his brain and is unable to control his hyper emotions about few things which makes him a beast at times. He would not even hesitate to kill and does not like anyone being praised or belittling him. In this process, he builds a grudge against his own brother who is good at everything and tries to kill him right during their childhood. Their mother (Seetha) is unable to tolerate all this and takes it upon herself to change Ram, so she takes him away from Hari to avoid further hatred but then not much change happens in the nature of Ram even after they grow up. Meanwhile, Hari is often chased by Anjali (Priyamani) who poses as a bank employee but in truth she is actually a CBI officer who comes to arrest Hari since she suspects his hand in the killings. Apparently, the doctor happens to be the younger brother of the health minister Siva Reddy (Kota Srinivasa Rao) and from then on the minister is closely on the heels of the killer. Anjali finally manages to arrest Hari successfully through a plan of hers and soon she realizes her folly when she chances upon his mother and understands the entire story of Hari and Ram.
Ram is initially thought to have committed the murders. Here comes a twist! Sravani (Sindhu Tolani), a journalist (Ram's love interest) was jointly killed by the channel owner and the health minister when she exposes their plans of running a health mafia. Ram attacked the doctor to seek revenge. The doctor injected Ram with the deadly virus and Ram, deciding to sacrifice himself to save the people around him, fell under Hari's car. He then asked Hari to shoot him to save the others. Hari shot him with no other alternative left. He then decided to kill the culprits by impersonating Ram. Hari is released from jail by the court for the purpose of catching. He then kidnaps the Health Minister in a van and takes him to a lonely place. When the policemen and the others gather there, Hari escapes from the van by means of the sewage pipe and gets into the public. He then triggers a bomb in the van. Ram's mother thinks that Ram sacrificed his life for the country and feels proud of him.

Daddy's Home 2,comedy,"After finally becoming friends at the end of the first film, Brad Whittaker and Dusty Mayron have a co-dad system where their two children, Megan and Dylan, take turns at each father's house. Dusty has also remarried, this time to Karen, a writer, and is stepdad to Adrianna, Karen's daughter.
Brad and his wife, Sara, along with Dusty and Karen, attend a school play for Megan, where she announces to the whole audience that she doesn't like the fact that she has to go back and forth to different houses all the time. Back at the house, after the play, Brad and Dusty decide to do away with having two separate Christmases and instead do one ""together Christmas"". Dusty, however, finds out his tough fighter pilot/astronaut father Kurt (Mel Gibson) is coming for Christmas.
At the airport the next day, Dusty tells Brad that his father is going to make fun of them since he won't understand their co-dad arrangement. When Kurt arrives, he mistakes Brad for a chauffeur. When Dusty explains that Brad is the stepdad to his children, Kurt doesn't like it. Brad's overbearing and over-cheerful dad, Don, arrives next, unnerving Kurt. Don tells Brad that his mother didn't come along, because she is taking care of Brad's Uncle who isn't feeling well.
Back at the house, Megan and Dylan warmly embrace Don, since he is very present in their lives, while Kurt hasn't seen the children since they were toddlers. Kurt rents a large cabin through Airbnb, to house all of them through the holiday week. As Brad and Dusty pack the bags into the car, Dusty tells Brad that Kurt thinks the two men are harboring bad feelings for each other, but are just hiding it from everyone by pretending to be friends. When Kurt comes up, they change the subject.
Throughout the week, Brad and Dusty's co-dad relationship is put to the test by Kurt's meddling. Meanwhile, Dusty tries to get close to his stepdaughter, Adrianna, but she doesn't like him and repeatedly tells him that he isn't her father. Sara also tries to bond with Karen but is taken aback by some of Karen's actions, like shoplifting clothes from a store. Dylan develops a crush on a little girl staying in the cabin next door. He gets made fun of it by Megan and Adrianna.
The next day, the family goes out to take the kids to see Santa. While there, Kurt convinces Dylan to ask Santa for a shotgun, which he does ask for. Brad and Sara tell Dylan that a shotgun for hunting means that a poor innocent animal will lose its life. This convinces Dylan to change his mind, but Megan instead decides she wants to go hunting. While out hunting the next day, Megan accidentally shoots Kurt in the shoulder, sending him to the hospital.
At the hospital, Dusty and Kurt begin to bond after they almost begin fighting when Kurt tries to leave the hospital. That night, Brad, Dusty, Don & Kurt go to an improv comedy club where the four men are relaxing and having a good time watching the show. Kurt gets up to go get another drink at the bar. Dusty sees Kurt picking up a woman at the bar and leaves with her. Brad enters Don into the improv show, and Dusty chooses a topic of a husband confronting his cheating wife as the subject of an improv skit. As the skit progresses, it is revealed that Don has separated from his wife in real life. The audience believes that this is all part of the show, even when Brad tries to tell the audience that it is not.
The next day, Brad confronts Dusty. After Dusty reveals that he chose the infidelity subject for the improv game because he wanted to get back at Brad, because of how Brad has a good relationship with Don. Brad says he knows that is why Dusty chose that particular topic and to get back at Dusty; Brad has invited Adrianna's real dad, Roger, to the cabin for Christmas.
That evening, the entire family takes part in a Christmas manger representation. Brad gets into a fight with Dusty after Brad wants to play Joseph, which Dusty is currently playing. This breaks out in front of a crowd that is watching. Instead of Dusty fighting Brad, he almost comes to blows with Roger.
The next morning, Christmas Day, the families all pack up to leave. On their way out of town, the families are forced back to town on account of a blizzard. They are forced to take shelter at a movie theater. With every other movie being sold out, due to the huge influx of business from other families seeking shelter at the theater, both families go to see the last movie available: Missile Tow, a fictitious Liam Neeson holiday action film.
When the power cuts off during the movie, the families go to the lobby where each man confronts their father about the secrets, lies, and attitudes. Don confronts Brad about not telling him the truth about his divorce, while Dusty tries to talk to Kurt. When Dylan sees the girl he has a crush on, is also there at the theater, he is teased again by Megan and Adrianna. After remembering some advice given to him by Kurt, Dylan walks toward her to kiss her. All of a sudden, he doesn't kiss her, but instead kisses Adrianna, his stepsister. Roger gets freaked out and attempts to leave with Adrianna, but is confronted by Dusty. He deduces that the reason why Adrianna hasn't warmed up to him is that he has never told her that he loves her, which he does. He also tells Roger that loving Adrianna means loving her real father as well since he is also part of the family. Roger almost leaves without Adrianna, but has a change of heart after everyone breaks out into a song of Do They Know It's Christmas? and decides to stay. Don and Brad also reconcile.
Sometime later, at the airport, Don and Kurt are preparing to leave to head back to their respective homes. Kurt heads with Don up the terminal escalators, where he reveals to Don that he switched out the tickets and they're going to spend New Years in Las Vegas.
As Brad's mom's flight arrives, Dusty and Brad discover that Brad's new stepdad is Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the pilot of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" flight. Brad and Dusty remember that they watched the film ""Sully"" together not too long ago and Brad appears to be welcoming towards him. Brad runs down the terminal and says that Sully will never replace his father, because Sully has only one great personal story, whereas his father has thousands of stories.",comedy finally friend end film brad whittaker dusty mayron co dad system child megan dylan turn father house dusty remarry time karen writer stepdad adrianna karen daughter brad wife sara dusty karen attend school play megan announce audience like fact forth different house time house play brad dusty decide away have separate christmas instead christmas dusty find tough fighter pilot astronaut father kurt mel gibson come christmas airport day dusty tell brad father go fun will understand co dad arrangement kurt arrive mistake brad chauffeur dusty explain brad stepdad child kurt like brad overbearing cheerful dad don arrive unnerve kurt don tell brad mother come take care brad uncle feel house megan dylan warmly embrace don present life kurt see child toddler kurt rent large cabin airbnb house holiday week brad dusty pack bag car dusty tell brad kurt think man harbor bad feeling hide pretend friend kurt come change subject week brad dusty co dad relationship test kurt meddling dusty try close stepdaughter adrianna like repeatedly tell father sara try bond karen take aback karen action like shoplift clothe store dylan develop crush little girl stay cabin door get fun megan adrianna day family go kid santa kurt convince dylan ask santa shotgun ask brad sara tell dylan shotgun hunting mean poor innocent animal lose life convince dylan change mind megan instead decide want hunting hunt day megan accidentally shoot kurt shoulder send hospital hospital dusty kurt begin bond begin fight kurt try leave hospital night brad dusty don kurt improv comedy club man relax have good time watch kurt get drink bar dusty see kurt pick woman bar leave brad enter don improv dusty choose topic husband confront cheat wife subject improv skit skit progress reveal don separate wife real life audience believe brad try tell audience day brad confront dusty dusty reveal choose infidelity subject improv game want brad brad good relationship don brad say know dusty choose particular topic dusty brad invite adrianna real dad roger cabin christmas evening entire family take christmas manger representation brad get fight dusty brad want play joseph dusty currently play break crowd watch instead dusty fighting brad come blow roger morning christmas day family pack leave way town family force town account blizzard force shelter movie theater movie sell huge influx business family seek shelter theater family movie available missile tow fictitious liam neeson holiday action film power cut movie family lobby man confront father secret lie attitude don confront brad tell truth divorce dusty try talk kurt dylan see girl crush theater tease megan adrianna remember advice give kurt dylan walk kiss sudden kiss instead kiss adrianna stepsister roger get freak attempt leave adrianna confront dusty deduce reason adrianna warm tell love tell roger love adrianna mean love real father family roger leave adrianna change heart break song know christmas decide stay don brad reconcile later airport don kurt prepare leave head respective home kurt head don terminal escalator reveal don switch ticket go spend new year las vegas brad mom flight arrive dusty brad discover brad new stepdad chesley sully sullenberger pilot miracle hudson flight brad dusty remember watch film sully long ago brad appear welcome brad run terminal say sully replace father sully great personal story father thousand story
Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules,"comedy, family","The Heffley family attends a party at a roller rink, where Greg Heffley reunites with his best friend Rowley Jefferson, meets a new girl at school named Holly Hills who Greg instantly has a crush on, and reveals he passed on the Cheese Touch. During the party, his older brother Rodrick embarrasses Greg by suggesting that he ask Holly to skate with him and then interfering with Couples Skate by persuading a crowd of violent teenagers to enter the rink, along with replacing ""Always"" by Atlantic Starr with a heavy metal song. This prompts Greg's parents (who misunderstand this) to speak to Greg on the rink's public address system and then carry him off the rink. Greg, extremely angry with Rodrick for humiliating him, tries to tackle him, but he misses and in turn, lands in Taylor Pringle's birthday cake. She and her friends then proceed to beat up Greg as the intro starts.
Rodrick and Greg's mother, Susan Heffley, makes an effort to have them bond by going in their bedroom and doing some things together by using her methods called ""Mom Bucks"", but it makes things worse as Rodrick cheats her system. At school, the teacher treats Greg as a bad kid and immediately dislike Greg because Greg's related to Rodrick much to Greg's dismay. After school, a school talent show is advertised on TV; in which Rowley sees it as an opportunity to perform magic, and Rodrick sees it as a big break for his band, Löded Diper. However, Greg rejects the idea of doing the magic. Susan also gets permission from Rowley’s mom so Rowley can come with Greg’s family to Rockin Rapids, a water park, though Rowley prefers to stay home and practice his magic act for the talent show.
At church, Greg and Rodrick are grounded after a scuffle, causing Susan to get upset about what others think of her, and her family's reputation being ruined; after which, they are forbidden to go to the water park, nor inviting people over, and told that they must bond. However, Rodrick does the opposite, and throws a party. Though, this party causes Rodrick to be more friendly and open towards Greg.
The next morning, Susan calls and says that they will be home in one hour. Rodrick and Greg hastily erase all the evidence, but find out that the bathroom door is painted on with a graffiti; therefore, they replace the door, but Greg finds out that the replacement door doesn't have a lock like the last door. Rodrick convinces Greg to deny everything as their parents arrive. Susan however, later slowly began to discovers the difference and questions the two brothers. Though Rodrick denies this, Greg nearly reveals the truth and convinces Susan to not to punish Rodrick. Convinced that Greg didn't reveal about the party, Rodrick starts bonding with him as a gesture of gratitude.
One night, they are finally exposed when their father Frank Heffley comes across photos of the party and the Heffley's reputation is ruined again, and no one will support Susan's articles about siblings bonding anymore. Greg and Rodrick both get grounded, which includes Rodrick not being allowed to participate in the school talent show. Their punishment is to stay at the retirement home with their Grandpa is staying, in which Greg finds out that Holly is visiting her grandmother. Holly tells Greg that she can relate to Greg about siblings giving her a hard time; however, siblings will eventually get over it. Holly also reveals she is more patient and mature than her siblings.
The next day, to humiliate Greg, Rodrick reads and steals Greg's diary — in which Greg has written about his crush on Holly — and attempts to hand it over to Holly. Greg, with only his underwear on, chases after Rodrick and takes the diary back, but he accidentally hides in the women's restroom and when Greg returns, Rodrick reveals to Greg that he tapes the whole incident.
At the talent show a few nights later, Rodrick finds out that he has been booted from the band by Bill Walter, a band member who recently joined; Rowley isn't able to perform his magic tricks due to his partner having stage fright. Greg, with a change of heart, helps Rowley and Rodrick out by participating in Rowley's magic act in return for allowing Rodrick to perform his band act. The next morning, Rodrick gives Greg the tape from the retirement home in return for making it possible for him to participate, symbolizing that they are not only brothers, but also friends.
In a mid-credits scene, Greg and Rowley have just finished posting the video that Frank shot of Rodrick's music act with Susan dancing on YouTube, and it goes viral, making Greg and Rowley an internet sensation.

Wings,war,"Jack Powell and David Armstrong are rivals in the same small American town, both vying for the attentions of pretty Sylvia Lewis. Jack fails to realize that ""the girl next door"", Mary Preston, is desperately in love with him. The two young men both enlist to become combat pilots in the Air Service. When they leave for training camp, Jack mistakenly believes Sylvia prefers him. She actually prefers David and lets him know about her feelings, but is too kindhearted to turn down Jack's affection.
Jack and David are billeted together. Their tent mate is Cadet White, but their acquaintance is all too brief; White is killed in an air crash the same day. Undaunted, the two men endure a rigorous training period, where they go from being enemies to best friends. Upon graduating, they are shipped off to France to fight the Germans.

In breach of existing treaties, Baylor plans to resettle the Apaches to the San Carlos Reservation, and when Geronimo (Jay Silverheels), the chief of the rival Mogollon Apaches, attacks the Tucson stagecoach and kills women and children, Baylor threatens to also transport the Chiricahuas to San Carlos. When confronted by Colton and Baylor, Cochise calls a council of Apache elders and they vote to banish Geronimo, who must also give up one of his stagecoach captives, schoolteacher Mary (Beverly Tyler). After assuring his pregnant wife Nona (Susan Cabot) that his interest in the attractive young schoolteacher is not romantic, Cochise brings Mary to Fort Buchanan and entrusts her to Maj. Colton, counseling him that she would be a fine wife.
At the same time Baylor and Jack plot with Geronimo to frame Cochise for Geronimo's attack on a ranch. During Colton's inquiry into the attack, his subordinate, Lt. Bascom (John Hudson), is promised a promotion by Baylor for rescuing the boy who was kidnapped during the attack. Cochise tells Bascom that it was Geronimo who committed the attack, but Bascom accuses him of lying and takes Nona hostage, while executing by hanging three braves, including Cochise's brother, Little Elk (Tommy Cook). As Cochise mourns and then prepares to retaliate against Bascom's position, Mescal Jack goes to him on the pretense of warning him about an Army attack, but Cochise calls him a liar and puts him to death. Colton's trusted Sgt. Bernard (Richard Egan) informs him of the situation, causing Colton to shut down Fort Buchanan and prepare to transfer everyone, including Mary and Baylor, to Fort Sheridan, a more secure redoubt, some distance away.
From the hills along the trail, Cochise watches the procession, as does Geronimo and, as shooting begins, the wounded Baylor goes towards the Indians' positions, shouting that he is their friend, but Geronimo kills him. Colton and Sgt. Bernard use the expedition's cannon to rout the warriors, as Cochise finds Nona, who has been hurt, and takes her to the wagons so that Army Dr. Carter (Regis Toomey) can treat her. Geronimo calls Cochise a weak leader, but in a one-to-one battle, Cochise wins and, instead of killing Geronimo, banishes him. Nona's son is born and Nona gives her friend Mary a precious Apache bracelet. Colton and Mary look at each other with affection and Cochise tells them that time has come for peace, as he rides away with Nona.",western civil war rage southeastern state southwest far away battle line new mexico territory good relation fort buchanan command officer maj colton john lund chiricahua apache chief cochise jeff chandler threaten arrival venal government agent baylor bruce cowling equally dishonest scout mescal jack jack elam breach exist treaty baylor plan resettle apache san carlos reservation geronimo jay silverheel chief rival mogollon apache attack tucson stagecoach kill woman child baylor threaten transport chiricahuas san carlos confront colton baylor cochise call council apache elder vote banish geronimo stagecoach captive schoolteacher mary beverly tyler assure pregnant wife nona susan cabot interest attractive young schoolteacher romantic cochise bring mary fort buchanan entrust maj colton counsel fine wife time baylor jack plot geronimo frame cochise geronimo attack ranch colton inquiry attack subordinate lt bascom john hudson promise promotion baylor rescue boy kidnap attack cochise tell bascom geronimo commit attack bascom accuse lie take nona hostage execute hang brave include cochise brother little elk tommy cook cochise mourn prepare retaliate bascom position mescal jack go pretense warn army attack cochise call liar put death colton trust sgt bernard richard egan inform situation cause colton shut fort buchanan prepare transfer include mary baylor fort sheridan secure redoubt distance away hill trail cochise watch procession geronimo shoot begin wound baylor go indians position shout friend geronimo kill colton sgt bernard use expedition cannon rout warrior cochise find nona hurt take wagon army dr carter regis toomey treat geronimo call cochise weak leader battle cochise win instead kill geronimo banish nona son bear nona give friend mary precious apache bracelet colton mary look affection cochise tell time come peace ride away nona
The Patriot,war,"During the American Revolution in 1776, Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the French and Indian War and a widower with seven children, is called to Charleston to vote in the South Carolina General Assembly on a levy supporting the Continental Army. Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continental Army.
Two years later Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons rifles, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the ""Ghost"". Gabriel decides to rejoin the Continentals and Benjamin soon follows, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General Horatio Gates engaging the British Army. Benjamin recognizes the foolishness of the action; sure enough, the Continentals are decisively routed.
Benjamin meets his former commanding officer, Colonel Harry Burwell, who makes him colonel of the local colonial militia due to his combat experience and also places Gabriel under Benjamin's command. Benjamin is tasked with keeping Lord Cornwallis's regiments pinned south through guerrilla warfare. French Major Jean Villeneuve helps train the militia and promises more French aid.
Gabriel asks why Villeneuve and others often mention Benjamin's role in something called ""Fort Wilderness."" Benjamin, having been hesitant to answer the question up to now, finally tells his son the story. Benjamin had been fighting in the British Army in the French and Indian War when he and several other soldiers discovered a French atrocity at a fort that Benjamin and his comrades had been trying to reinforce. In a bloodthirsty rage, Benjamin and his comrades caught up with the French at Fort Wilderness, where Benjamin and his unit literally cut the defending French soldiers apart slowly. Benjamin reveals that he has been haunted by guilt ever since.
Benjamin's militia harass British supply lines, even capturing some of Cornwallis' personal effects and his two Great Danes, and burn half the bridges and ferries leading to Charleston. Lord Cornwallis blames Tavington for creating this reaction with his brutal tactics. However, irritated at the lack of progress, and insulted by Benjamin's clever ploy to free some of the captured militia, Cornwallis reluctantly allows Tavington to stop Benjamin by any means necessary.
With the reluctant aid of the Loyalist Captain Wilkins, Tavington learns the identities of some militia members and proceeds to attack their families and burn their homes. Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned to live in a Gullah settlement with former black slaves. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed Anne. Tavington's brigade rides into the town that supplies the militia. He assembles all the townspeople, including Anne, into the church promising freedom in exchange for the whereabouts of the rebels. However, after the location is given the doors are barricaded, trapping the people as Tavington orders the church burned, killing them all in a cold-blooded act of mass-murder. After discovering the tragedy, Gabriel and several others race to attack Tavington's encampment. In the ensuing fight, Tavington mortally wounds Gabriel before fleeing. Benjamin arrives soon after, only to have another of his sons die in his arms.
Benjamin mourns and wavers in his commitment to continue fighting, but is resolved when reminded of his son's dedication to the cause by finding an American flag he repaired personally. Martin's militia, along with a larger Continental Army regiment, confronts Cornwallis' regiment in a decisive battle at the Battle of Cowpens. The British appear to have the upper hand until Benjamin rallies the troops forward against their lines and Tavington rushes to personally target him. The two duel and Tavington gains the upper hand, delivering several wounds to Benjamin. A beaten Benjamin slumps to his knees, and Tavington prepares to deliver the coup de grâce. At the last second, however, Benjamin dodges the attack and stabs Tavington to death, avenging his sons' deaths. The battle is a Continental victory and Cornwallis is forced to retreat.
After many eventual retreats, Cornwallis is besieged at Yorktown, Virginia where he surrenders to the surrounding Continental Army and the long-awaited French naval force. After the conflict ends, Benjamin returns with his family and discovers his militia men rebuilding his homestead in their new nation.",war american revolution benjamin martin veteran french indian war widower seven child call charleston vote south carolina general assembly levy support continental army fear war great britain benjamin abstain vote nonetheless pass father wish benjamin eld son gabriel join continental army year later charleston fall british wound gabriel return home carry dispatch martin care british american wound nearby battle british dragoon lead ruthless colonel william tavington arrive arrest gabriel captive african american free man woman work benjamin land benjamin second son thomas try free gabriel shoot kill tavington order martin house burn wound americans execute british leave benjamin give eld son rifle ambush british unit escort tie gabriel benjamin skillfully brutally kill soldier tomahawk british survivor tell tavington attack earn benjamin moniker ghost gabriel decide rejoin continental benjamin soon follow leave young child care benjamin sister law charlotte way continental army camp witness southern continental army general horatio gate engage british army benjamin recognize foolishness action sure continental decisively route benjamin meet commanding officer colonel harry burwell make colonel local colonial militia combat experience place gabriel benjamin command benjamin task keep lord cornwallis regiment pin south guerrilla warfare french major jean villeneuve help train militia promise french aid gabriel ask villeneuve mention benjamin role call fort wilderness benjamin having hesitant answer question finally tell son story benjamin fight british army french indian war soldier discover french atrocity fort benjamin comrade try reinforce bloodthirsty rage benjamin comrade catch french fort wilderness benjamin unit literally cut defend french soldier apart slowly benjamin reveal haunt guilt benjamin militia harass british supply line capture cornwalli personal effect great dane burn half bridge ferry lead charleston lord cornwallis blame tavington create reaction brutal tactic irritate lack progress insult benjamin clever ploy free capture militia cornwalli reluctantly allow tavington stop benjamin mean necessary reluctant aid loyalist captain wilkin tavington learn identity militia member proceed attack family burn home benjamin family flee charlotte plantation burn live gullah settlement black slave gabriel marry betrothed anne tavington brigade ride town supply militia assemble townspeople include anne church promise freedom exchange whereabouts rebel location give door barricade trap people tavington order church burn kill cold blooded act mass murder discover tragedy gabriel race attack tavington encampment ensue fight tavington mortally wound gabriel flee benjamin arrive soon son die arm benjamin mourn waver commitment continue fight resolve remind son dedication cause find american flag repair personally martin militia large continental army regiment confront cornwallis regiment decisive battle battle cowpen british appear upper hand benjamin rally troop forward line tavington rush personally target duel tavington gain upper hand deliver wound benjamin beat benjamin slump knee tavington prepare deliver coup de grâce second benjamin dodge attack stab tavington death avenge son death battle continental victory cornwalli force retreat eventual retreat cornwallis besiege yorktown virginia surrender surround continental army long await french naval force conflict end benjamin return family discover militia man rebuild homestead new nation

The Phantom of the Opera: The Motion Picture,horror,"Christine Day (Jill Schoelen), a young opera singer in modern-day Manhattan, is searching for a unique piece to sing at her next audition. Her friend and manager Meg (Molly Shannon) discovers an old opera piece called Don Juan Triumphant, written by a composer named Erik Destler. Curious, Christine and Meg do a little research on Destler, and discover he may have been responsible for many murders and the disappearance of a young female opera singer he was said to have been obsessed with. While Christine is alone, she sings from the tattered parchment and blood seeps from the notes and covers her hands. Shocked, she discovers this to be an illusion when Meg returns. Christine auditions with the piece and during her performance, an accident with a falling sandbag renders her unconscious and shatters a mirror. She awakens in London in 1881, wearing opera clothing. A different version of Meg (Emma Rawson) is also there. Christine turns out to be the understudy to the diva La Carlotta (Stephanie Lawrence), who is both jealous and resentful of Christine’s skill. During this whole time, Erik Destler (Robert Englund) attacks the scene-shifter Joseph (Terence Beesley) with a blade high above the rafters for almost killing Christine with the falling sandbag, and blaming the accident on him.
Alone in her dressing room Christine hears the voice of Erik Destler, revealing he is her teacher and an angel sent by her deceased father. Destler encourages her to practice Carlotta's part of Marguerite in Faust, saying that only she can sing the part. Christine complies. That evening, Carlotta discovers Joseph’s skinned (but barely alive) body in her dressing closet. The event causes her to scream and lose her voice. Christine is cast in the role of Marguerite, which causes a panic to the opera house owner Martin Barton (Bill Nighy), who favors Carlotta and the prestige she brings to his opera house.
During the scene where Dr. Faust signs his soul to the Devil, Destler reminisces about a time, decades ago, when he sold his own soul to the Devil in exchange for people loving him for his music. The Devil grants his wish, but disfigures Destler’s face, telling him that only his music will be what people love him for. Christine gives a stellar performance, receiving a standing ovation, and celebrates that night with her fiancé Richard Dutton (Alex Hyde-White). She tells him of her mysterious ""teacher"", to whom she accredits her success. A mildly jealous Richard asks to meet this teacher, but Christine insists her teacher is only a figment of her imagination. Meanwhile, Destler seduces a prostitute and pays her gold to call herself ""Christine"" for the night.
Shockingly, the next morning in the papers, Christine is given a bad review by the famous opera critic A. Harrison, secretly done as a favor to Barton. Destler tracks Harrison down and brutally murders him in a Turkish spa after Harrison refuses to recant his review. Christine tearfully goes to the graveyard and prays at her father's grave. Destler appears as a shadowy violinist and offers her a chance at musical immortality if she will only go to him. Christine goes away with the Phantom in his stagecoach. Deep in the sewers below London’s opera house, Destler reveals himself as the composer of Don Juan Triumphant, which causes a spark of recollection within Christine and she sings the same lyrics from the beginning of the film. Destler places his ring upon her finger and warns her never to see another man again. Christine, through fear, promises she will not. Destler kisses her hand declaring her to be his bride. Richard goes to Inspector Hawkins (Terence Harvey), who reveals that the Phantom is not only the legendary Erik Destler, but has lived for decades, uses the opera house's catacombs as a hideout, and skins his murdered victims for their facial skin to cover his own hideous visage. Richard hears that the only way to kill the Phantom is to destroy his music.
After hearing of Harrison's murder, Christine meets Richard at a masquerade ball and begs him to take her away. She fears the Phantom and really loves Richard. Erik, disguised as Red Death, witnesses this exchange and becomes enraged. He decapitates Carlotta, causing a mayhem, and kidnaps Christine. Hawkins, Richard, and the rat catcher (Yehuda Efroni), whom Destler has been bribing in the past, go quickly in pursuit. Back in the Phantom’s lair, an enraged Destler attempts to rape Christine, but hears the men approaching. He tells Christine she can never leave and locks her in the lair. Two policemen become lost in the sewers and are killed by Destler, including the rat catcher for betraying him.
He returns to Christine who asks him if he is going to kill her too. Destler replies ""This is either a wedding march or a funeral mass. You decide which."" Richard and Inspector Hawkins burst in. After a brutal fight with the Phantom, Richard is stabbed, set aflame, and killed instantly. Christine sets the lair on fire by pushing over candelabras and attempts to kill Destler, but he grabs her hand and tries to lead her away with him. However, a wounded Hawkins manages to shoot Destler. Christine pushes another candle holder through a mirror which sends her back to her own time. As she vanishes, she hears Destler's echoing voice screaming her name.
Christine awakens back to the present-day in Manhattan and meets the opera’s producer, Mr. Foster, who comforts her and offers her the leading part. At his apartment, they have drinks and Foster goes upstairs to change and finds a blemish on his face, revealing that Foster is really Destler from long ago. He prepares to change his facial skin with synthetic ones he keeps in a special lab. Meanwhile, downstairs, Christine discovers a copy of the Don Juan Triumphant music score. Foster/Destler enters, reveals his true identity to her and lovingly kisses her lips. Christine pretends to accept him then rips off his mask, stabs him and escapes, taking his music. She tears it apart and lets it drop into a drain, whilst Foster/Destler is heard screaming.
On her way home, Christine passes by a street violin player, whom she gives some money to. The violinist starts playing the theme from Don Juan Triumphant. Christine looks back and reflects on the music for a while. Then, very resolutely, she turns around and continues on her way, wondering if Destler is really gone for good.",horror christine day jill schoelen young opera singer modern day manhattan search unique piece sing audition friend manager meg molly shannon discover old opera piece call don juan triumphant write composer name erik destler curious christine meg little research destler discover responsible murder disappearance young female opera singer say obsess christine sing tattered parchment blood seep note cover hand shock discover illusion meg return christine audition piece performance accident fall sandbag render unconscious shatter mirror awaken london wear opera clothing different version meg emma rawson christine turn understudy diva la carlotta stephanie lawrence jealous resentful christine skill time erik destler robert englund attack scene shifter joseph terence beesley blade high rafter kill christine fall sandbag blame accident dressing room christine hear voice erik destler reveal teacher angel send deceased father destler encourage practice carlotta marguerite faust say sing christine complie evening carlotta discover joseph skin barely alive body dress closet event cause scream lose voice christine cast role marguerite cause panic opera house owner martin barton bill nighy favor carlotta prestige bring opera house scene dr faust sign soul devil destler reminisce time decade ago sell soul devil exchange people love music devil grant wish disfigure destler face tell music people love christine give stellar performance receive standing ovation celebrate night fiancé richard dutton alex hyde white tell mysterious teacher accredit success mildly jealous richard ask meet teacher christine insist teacher figment imagination destler seduce prostitute pay gold christine night shockingly morning paper christine give bad review famous opera critic harrison secretly favor barton destler track harrison brutally murder turkish spa harrison refuse recant review christine tearfully go graveyard pray father grave destler appear shadowy violinist offer chance musical immortality christine go away phantom stagecoach deep sewer london opera house destler reveal composer don juan triumphant cause spark recollection christine sing lyric beginning film destler place ring finger warn man christine fear promise destler kiss hand declare bride richard go inspector hawkin terence harvey reveal phantom legendary erik destler live decade use opera house catacomb hideout skin murder victim facial skin cover hideous visage richard hear way kill phantom destroy music hearing harrison murder christine meet richard masquerade ball beg away fear phantom love richard erik disguise red death witness exchange enraged decapitate carlotta cause mayhem kidnap christine hawkins richard rat catcher yehuda efroni destler bribe past quickly pursuit phantom lair enrage destler attempt rape christine hear man approach tell christine leave lock lair policeman lose sewer kill destler include rat catcher betray return christine ask go kill destler reply wedding march funeral mass decide richard inspector hawkin burst brutal fight phantom richard stab set aflame kill instantly christine set lair fire push candelabra attempt kill destler grab hand try lead away wound hawkin manage shoot destler christine push candle holder mirror send time vanish hear destler echo voice scream christine awaken present day manhattan meet opera producer mr foster comfort offer lead apartment drink foster go upstairs change find blemish face reveal foster destler long ago prepare change facial skin synthetic one keep special lab downstairs christine discover copy don juan triumphant music score foster destler enter reveal true identity lovingly kiss lip christine pretend accept rip mask stab escape take music tear apart let drop drain whilst foster destler hear scream way home christine pass street violin player give money violinist start play theme don juan triumphant christine look reflect music resolutely turn continue way wonder destler go good

Into the Blue,thriller,"A sea plane flying on a stormy night malfunctions and crashes in the sea off the coast of the Bahamas.
Jared and Sam are lovers living a rustic life in a trailer, next to the beach in the Bahamas. Sam works as a guide in the local aquatic theme park, while Jared works a number of odd jobs in his field of passion, diving. His real dream is to find one of many treasure-filled merchant and pirate ships lost in the waters around the Bahamas. Derek Bates has similar dreams and a better boat, but Jared turns down repeated offers to work for him.
Jared's childhood friend, Bryce, and his girlfriend, Amanda (whom he just met the night before), come to visit. Bryce, a lawyer in New York City, has acquired the use of a luxury vacation house from a client he defended. While snorkeling, Jared finds artifacts on the sea bed that seem to stem from a ship wreck. The four of them investigate and find several other pieces that turn out to be the remains of legendary French pirate ship Zephyr. They also discover the crashed plane and its cargo of cocaine—Bryce and Amanda want to recover it, but Jared refuses, dispersing the brick they retrieved into the ocean.
Needing money for equipment to salvage the treasure, Bryce and Amanda dive to the plane then try to sell a few bricks of recovered cocaine to local night club owner Primo. Primo turns out to be an associate of drug lord Reyes, to whom the cocaine belonged in the first place.
Jared, Bryce, and Amanda are threatened by Reyes, who demands that they retrieve his cocaine or face deadly consequences. When the trio inform Sam, she berates Jared for violating his principles by helping a drug lord. He tries to explain the situation, but she leaves him, saying that 'they' are over. After nightfall, Jared, Bryce, and Amanda dive at the plane wreck to salvage the cocaine and more artifacts. As they are moving the cocaine packs from the plane to their boat, Amanda is attacked and bitten on the leg by a tiger shark. They abandon the cocaine at the dive site to rush her to the hospital, where she dies. Hearing of the tragedy, Sam reunites with Jared, mourning for the loss of Amanda.
Sam insists on going to the police, and goes to the home of one of their friends, a local cop named Roy. Roy turns her over to Derek Bates, knowing that he was Reyes' partner in the cocaine deal. Primo has captured Jared and taken him aboard Reyes' ship, where they find that Bates has killed Reyes and his entire crew, eventually killing Primo and Roy as well.
Jared and Bryce learn of Sam's captivity, and set out to rescue her from Bates' ship, now anchored over the cocaine plane. Sam is handcuffed and gagged with duct tape. They kill Bates' divers at the plane, while their friend Danny helps Sam dispatch the men on Bates' boat. Below, Jared and Bates are the only ones left. Jared confronts Bates in the plane, eventually using an air tank as a missile by hammering off the valve. Bates dodges it, but it hits the fuel tank at the back of the plane, causing a major explosion, killing Bates. Sam jumps into the water and rescues Jared.
Six weeks later, the trio is salvaging the Zephyr. While trying to bring an old cannon to the surface, the rope breaks and the cannon sinks back down breaking a part of the ship.

The Clinic,thriller,"The Clinic is set in the year 1978 (six years prior to the advent of DNA testing). A young mother-to-be, Beth, is traveling with her fiancé Cameron. After narrowly avoiding an accident on the road, they stop at a motel in the small town of Montgomery. Cameron goes for a midnight stroll and comes back to find his fiancée missing. After a quick search, Cameron calls the local police. Following the arrival of the police, Cameron attacks the motel owner out of frustration and the authorities arrest him. He later attempts to escape and is killed in a car crash.
Beth later awakens naked in an abandoned warehouse, lying in a bath tub filled with ice and water. She discovers a C-section scar on her abdomen and realizes her baby has been stolen. She also finds a white smock with the Roman numeral DCVIII written on the breast. Alone and afraid for her child, Beth wanders outside of the facility where she finds three other mothers who have also been kidnapped and had their unborn children surgically removed. The group finds another woman, barely alive, with her womb surgically opened, who declares her child to be “blue.""
As the mothers search around, they discover that their babies are alive and locked in cages, with colored clips that are matched to a colored tag sewn inside their true mother's abdomen. The only way to match the mother to the child is to remove the tag from their abdomens, which will lead to death by blood loss. One of the mothers decides the only way to find out which baby is hers is to kill the other women, remove their tag, and find her baby through the process of elimination. One by one, the women are picked off by the crazed mother until Beth catches and fatally injures her. Before she dies, she threatens to drop the remaining tag down a hole unless Beth promises to take care of her baby as well. The woman dies and Beth takes the tag from her hand. She then uses the tags to find the color for her baby. As she returns to find that the babies are no longer in their crib cages, she is knocked out by an unknown assailant.
Beth regains consciousness and finds herself chained to the floor. She sees a Russian couple inspecting her baby and they reveal their scam: prospective parents receive a baby to adopt based on their mother's performance in the warehouse experiment; the winning mother has the strongest child and that child is the one set for adoption.

Decoys 2,"sci-fi, horror","Set in a different northwestern city some years after the events of the first film, the film opens with a beautiful girl, Delia (Michelle Molineux), making out with a guy in a car on cold, snowy night. After being interrupted by a passing-by officer, the two resume their activity only for tentacles to erupt from Delia's chest.
In an Evolutionary Biology class held by Prof. Erwin Buckton (Tobin Bell), the first film's protagonist, Luke Callahan (Corey Sevier), is shown to have survived his encounter with Alex (Meghan Ory). Part of the class are Sam Compton (Tyler Johnston) and Stephanie Baxter (Kailin See). When Prof. Buckton's class ends, Luke sees from a distance one of the aliens he had a hand in killing previously: Constance Snowden (Kim Poirier). Constance now is under the guise of a doctor. He later visits his psychiatrist, Dr. Alana Geisner (Dina Meyer). Though he tells her the Aliens and the events of the first film are a product of his dreams and hallucinations instead of actual events, he reveals to her that he doesn't know how he survived, only that he woke up in a hospital days later being attended by a psychiatrist. Dr. Geisner hands Luke a full container of Anti-Hallucigens which only seems to make Luke more agitated.
Sam returns to his dorm room where his friends and dormmates - Henry Robbins, Peter Brunson and Nick Dean - hatch a sex-fuel competition to see who can hook-up with the most co-eds by the end of the summer with the winner earning a hefty sum of cash. It involves recording the event as proof while also keeping it all a big secret. Initially against the idea, Sam is convinced to join.
Another alien disguised as an attractive human female, Jasmine (Lindsay Maxwell), is caught speeding by the same officer from the start of the film. She seduces but accidentally kills the officer.
Luke mistakens Stephanie for Constance but is able to ease the situation. The two chat while heading for Stephanie's dorm about Constance which Luke says was a girl his best friend used to like but she did bad things to him. All the while Constance has been viewing them from a far. Now the leader of the Decoys, Constance warns her fellow Decoys, Jasmine and Delia, not to leave behind bodies for the police to find. Learning from Luke's survival, Constance deduces that their mates need to have passion and must be slowly aroused and excited even further. Using this tactic, the Decoys use their telepathy to figure out their intended mates fetishes and secret desires. Constance heads over to Prof. Buckton's office where she falsely warns him that Luke is a paranoid and delusional man obsessed with aliens. Buckton would later find Luke drawing remarkably detailed sketches of the Decoys with one looking very similar to Constance.
Sam, Henry, Peter and Nick head for a bar to initiate their competition. Only Nick succeeds. Later that night, Henry meets Delia who discovers his fetish of leopard skin clothes. In spite of it all, Henry resists her due to him being a virgin. An old friend of Sam's, Arnold Steiner, discovers the four's competition and persuades them to let him join. Despite having been told to keep it a secret, Arnold blurts it out to several of their male schoolmates who then want to partake. Arnold gets seduced by Jasmine. He borrows Sam's phone and follows Jasmine outside to the cold. Jasmine dresses up as a Dominatrix which has the desired effect the Decoys want. Jasmine successfully mates with Arnold but is interrupted by Sam who saw partial footage of Arnold in danger sent from his phone before it froze over. Sam finds a paralyzed Arnold and his phone and calls for the police. But Arnold's body ends up missing causing the police to dismiss Sam's call as a prank and claim that Arnold simply left.
Stephanie tells Sam of Luke's supposed hallucinations of the aliens and informs him that they are ""allergic to fire"". Peter encounters Delia who dresses up like a school girl. Delia fails in her attempt as Peter accidentally turns on the heating system. Peter relays what happened to Sam and Henry, saying that she was ""allergic to fire"". Sam rushes over to Stephanie's dorm and then they break into Luke's dormroom where they find multiple newspaper clippings about aliens and frozen bodies. Stephanie opens a window claiming, ""It's too hot in here.""
Luke has another appointment with Dr. Geisner who at first he suspected of being a Decoy. Dr. Geisner clears up that she isn't and that Luke can trust her. Luke meets Sam outside who reveals believes him. Luke sees Constance and chases after her but is hindered by Sam and a hospital guard. Dr. Geisner has him detained as a patient, but Sam would later sneak him out of the hospital.
Luke and Sam set out to find the Decoys in a Hawaiian theme party. The telltale sign being the lack of belly buttons. Sam finds a now blonde Stephanie dressed sexily being surrounded by boys. Stephanie takes Sam outside to the cold to escape the heat of the party. Meanwhile, Nick starts making out with Jasmine with Peter watching the live recording. Jasmine's tentacles burst from her chest but Nick is able to hold her off. Peter goes to get Sam and Henry for help. Sam luckily finds Stephanie's belly button. Stephanie realizes that Sam and Luke suspected her of being an alien and was about to walk away mad until Peter gets their attention. They see the footage of Nick being attacked by Jasmine. They arrive to Nick's aid and save him, as Jasmine takes off.
Luke realizes the Decoys have been using the hospital's morgue as a hideout and a nest due to the morgue being rarely used and cold. The group gathers some flares, prepares Molotov Cocktails and makes makeshift Flamethrowers using a lighter taped to a bottle of hairspray. In the hospital, Henry kills Delia, Peter and Nick kill Angeline, and Sam and Stephanie kill Jasmine for Arnold's sake. Dr. Geisner makes it in time to see the last Decoy Constance in her true form and assists Luke in killing her. Sam and Stephanie get together which makes Sam the winner since he actually got a girlfriend instead of a fling.
The group hear a sound from another room. There they find the missing victims including Prof. Buckton and Arnold who are still alive but cold and unconscious. Alien offspring soon start breaking out of their father's chests and the group is last heard screaming. The words ""The End... Maybe"" appear on screen before fading to black.",sci fi horror set different northwestern city year event film film open beautiful girl delia michelle molineux make guy car cold snowy night interrupt pass officer resume activity tentacle erupt delia chest evolutionary biology class hold prof erwin buckton tobin bell film protagonist luke callahan corey sevier show survive encounter alex meghan ory class sam compton tyler johnston stephanie baxter kailin prof buckton class end luke see distance alien hand kill previously constance snowden kim poirier constance guise doctor later visit psychiatrist dr alana geisner dina meyer tell alien event film product dream hallucination instead actual event reveal know survive wake hospital day later attend psychiatrist dr geisner hand luke container anti hallucigen luke agitated sam return dorm room friend dormmate henry robbin peter brunson nick dean hatch sex fuel competition hook co ed end summer winner earn hefty sum cash involve record event proof keep big secret initially idea sam convince join alien disguise attractive human female jasmine lindsay maxwell catch speed officer start film seduce accidentally kill officer luke mistaken stephanie constance able ease situation chat head stephanie dorm constance luke say girl good friend like bad thing constance view far leader decoy constance warn fellow decoy jasmine delia leave body police find learn luke survival constance deduce mate need passion slowly arouse excite tactic decoy use telepathy figure intend mate fetish secret desire constance head prof buckton office falsely warn luke paranoid delusional man obsess alien buckton later find luke draw remarkably detailed sketch decoy look similar constance sam henry peter nick head bar initiate competition nick succeed later night henry meet delia discover fetish leopard skin clothe spite henry resist virgin old friend sam arnold steiner discover competition persuade let join despite having tell secret arnold blurt male schoolmate want partake arnold get seduce jasmine borrow sam phone follow jasmine outside cold jasmine dress dominatrix desire effect decoy want jasmine successfully mate arnold interrupt sam see partial footage arnold danger send phone freeze sam find paralyzed arnold phone call police arnold body end miss cause police dismiss sam prank claim arnold simply left stephanie tell sam luke suppose hallucination alien inform allergic fire peter encounter delia dress like school girl delia fail attempt peter accidentally turn heating system peter relays happen sam henry say allergic fire sam rush stephanie dorm break luke dormroom find multiple newspaper clipping alien frozen body stephanie open window claiming hot luke appointment dr geisner suspect decoy dr geisner clear luke trust luke meet sam outside reveals believe luke see constance chase hinder sam hospital guard dr geisner detain patient sam later sneak hospital luke sam set find decoy hawaiian theme party telltale sign lack belly button sam find blonde stephanie dress sexily surround boy stephanie take sam outside cold escape heat party nick start make jasmine peter watch live recording jasmine tentacle burst chest nick able hold peter go sam henry help sam luckily find stephanie belly button stephanie realize sam luke suspect alien walk away mad peter get attention footage nick attack jasmine arrive nick aid save jasmine take luke realize decoy hospital morgue hideout nest morgue rarely cold group gather flare prepare molotov cocktail make makeshift flamethrower lighter tape bottle hairspray hospital henry kill delia peter nick kill angeline sam stephanie kill jasmine arnold sake dr geisner make time decoy constance true form assist luke kill sam stephanie make sam winner actually get girlfriend instead fling group hear sound room find miss victim include prof buckton arnold alive cold unconscious alien offspring soon start break father chest group hear scream word end maybe appear screen fade black

Octaman,sci-fi,"A scientific expedition to a remote Mexican fishing community, led by Dr. Rick Torres (Kerwin Mathews) and Susan Lowry (Pier Angeli), discovers unhealthy amounts of radiation in the local waters. They find a small mutant octopus that can crawl on land, and Torres travels back to the States to present his findings, hoping to be granted more funding. Reception from the scientific establishment is lukewarm, so Torres makes a deal with Johnny Caruso, a circus owner who is interested in the bizarre mutation as a carny act. After their departure, a humanoid octopus, Octaman, attacks the camp and slaughters the remaining crew.
The scientists return to the camp in an RV a few days later and find it abandoned. Davido, a young Indian man from the nearby village, says that a local legend about a creature said to be half man and half sea serpent is true, and offers to take the scientists to the lake where it is purported to live. Meanwhile, Octaman kills some villagers. The next day, the scientists find another small mutant octopus, and Octaman has gone to the camp and killed a crew member and escaped. Johnny, witness to the attack, decides to capture the monster for his circus.
Octaman returns to the RV, but Lowry honks the horn to signal for help. The other scientists arrive and the monster flees. They go searching for it on the lake, and it pulls down another crew member out of their boat. When it reappears at the RV and captures Lowry, they blind it with their flashlights to stop it in its tracks, then light a ring of gasoline around it. The fire consumes enough oxygen that the monster suffocates and falls unconscious, and Lowry gets rescued. They finish the capture by tranquilizing it and trapping it under a net. In the morning, however, a thunderstorm brings rain which revives the Octaman and allows it to escape. It moves to seize Lowry, but she manages to communicate with it and send it away.
Davido tracks Octaman into a cave. The others consider abandoning the pursuit, but Davido goads them on. Octaman chases them into the back of the cave, gaining enough time to block the cave mouth and seal them in. However, Davido manages to find another way out. They return to the RV, but find Octaman waiting for them inside. In order to spare her colleagues, Lowry communicates that she accepts to be captured. Now determined to kill the beast, the expedition members shoot it at close range, forcing it to release Lowry, and continue firing until the monster retreats into the lake and dies.",sci fi scientific expedition remote mexican fishing community lead dr rick torres kerwin mathews susan lowry pier angeli discover unhealthy amount radiation local water find small mutant octopus crawl land torre travel state present finding hope grant funding reception scientific establishment lukewarm torre make deal johnny caruso circus owner interested bizarre mutation carny act departure humanoid octopus octaman attack camp slaughter remain crew scientist return camp rv day later find abandon davido young indian man nearby village say local legend creature say half man half sea serpent true offer scientist lake purport live octaman kill villager day scientist find small mutant octopus octaman go camp kill crew member escape johnny witness attack decide capture monster circus octaman return rv lowry honk horn signal help scientist arrive monster flee search lake pull crew member boat reappear rv capture lowry blind flashlight stop track light ring gasoline fire consume oxygen monster suffocate fall unconscious lowry get rescue finish capture tranquilize trap net morning thunderstorm bring rain revive octaman allow escape move seize lowry manage communicate send away davido track octaman cave consider abandon pursuit davido goad octaman chase cave gain time block cave mouth seal davido manage find way return rv find octaman wait inside order spare colleague lowry communicate accept capture determine kill beast expedition member shoot close range force release lowry continue fire monster retreat lake die
Duplicity,crime,"Five years ago. Ray Koval (Clive Owen), an MI6 agent, meets Claire Stenwick (Julia Roberts), a CIA agent, at a party in Dubai. He is unaware of her identity and attempts to seduce her. Claire drugs him and steals classified documents from him.
Three years later in Rome. Ray and Claire meet for the first time since Dubai and spend several days together at a posh hotel. They imagine leaving their government jobs for work in an intensely competitive area in the private sector. They contemplate using their skills in intelligence to enrich themselves. After exploring possibilities over several months, including companies vying for the market in double-crust pizza, they settle on cosmetics and personal hygiene. How they will turn their positions to their advantage is unclear even to them, but they will be ready when the opportunity presents itself.
Claire accepts a job in counter-intelligence at Burkett & Randle. After more than a year, Ray takes a position in intelligence at Equikrom, where he will act as the handler and Claire as one of his agents.
Aware that Ray's new employer will be spying on him to assess his loyalty, he and Claire first practice how they will pretend to be meeting in New York for the first time since Dubai, reprising much of the dialog of their actual encounter in Rome. They are unaware that Claire's employers at Burkett & Randle are spying on her and hear this rehearsal, which blows her cover. Burkett & Randle CEO Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) decides to keep Claire in her job, even though she is a mole, and to manipulate her in his rivalry with Equikrom.
Claire and Ray, working as mole and handler, reprise the dialog yet again and, as they anticipated, Ray's employer is listening in and is persuaded that Ray is loyal.
Throughout the weeks that follow, Claire and Ray remain wary of one another. Both are experienced in double-dealing and despite their romantic connection and plans to escape with new identities once this operation is complete, neither is entirely free of the other's suspicion.
Tully makes a speech to his intelligence team, including Claire, that paints his company as the innovator defending itself from duplicity and theft. He underscores how the unannounced new product makes vigilance even more urgent. He and others in his organization plant information that they know she and the intelligence team at Equikrom will steal as they try to understand what that ""major development"" might be.
Claire provides a copy of this speech to Equikrom CEO Dick Garsik (Paul Giamatti), who plots to steal whatever Burkett & Randle has developed. His team, including Ray, devote themselves to stealing information from Burkett & Randle's offices, in the course of which Ray seduces one of their travel office employees and he and several others visit a casino in the Bahamas.
Thanks to information from Ray, Claire is able to appear a hero to her employers, catching Equikrom's spying activities after the fact or preventing them in some measure in the Bahamas. Tully at Burkett & Randle pretends to be impressed, thanks Claire for successfully defending the company's new product, and he reveals to her that it is a cure for baldness. She informs Garsik at Equikrom, who leaves for a shareholders meeting in Las Vegas expecting she will obtain the chemical formula and he will announce the new development to his shareholders before Burkett & Randle goes public with the information.
Excitement builds as the Equikrom team, using Claire as their principal source inside their rival's offices, succeed in acquiring a copy of the formula. Claire and Ray rendezvous at the Zürich Airport, each with a copy of the formula that they plan to sell to a Swiss company for $35 million. At the same time, Garsik tells his shareholders that they are in the final stages of testing for a product that cures baldness. The formula, the Swiss announce to Ray and Claire, is not what they think, just a harmless lotion. They in turn are disappointed, but impressed by how completely they were manipulated. They have only each other now, and a thank you bottle of champagne from Tully.",crime year ago ray koval clive owen agent meet claire stenwick julia roberts cia agent party dubai unaware identity attempt seduce claire drug steal classify document year later rome ray claire meet time dubai spend day posh hotel imagine leave government job work intensely competitive area private sector contemplate skill intelligence enrich explore possibility month include company vie market double crust pizza settle cosmetic personal hygiene turn position advantage unclear ready opportunity present claire accept job counter intelligence burkett randle year ray take position intelligence equikrom act handler claire agent aware ray new employer spy assess loyalty claire practice pretend meet new york time dubai reprise dialog actual encounter rome unaware claire employer burkett randle spy hear rehearsal blow cover burkett randle ceo howard tully tom wilkinson decide claire job mole manipulate rivalry equikrom claire ray work mole handler reprise dialog anticipate ray employer listen persuade ray loyal week follow claire ray remain wary experience double dealing despite romantic connection plan escape new identity operation complete entirely free suspicion tully make speech intelligence team include claire paint company innovator defend duplicity theft underscore unannounced new product make vigilance urgent organization plant information know intelligence team equikrom steal try understand major development claire provide copy speech equikrom ceo dick garsik paul giamatti plot steal burkett randle develop team include ray devote steal information burkett randle office course ray seduce travel office employee visit casino bahama thank information ray claire able appear hero employer catch equikrom spy activity fact prevent measure bahama tully burkett randle pretend impress thank claire successfully defend company new product reveal cure baldness inform garsik equikrom leave shareholder meeting las vegas expect obtain chemical formula announce new development shareholder burkett randle go public information excitement build equikrom team claire principal source inside rival office succeed acquire copy formula claire ray rendezvous zürich airport copy formula plan sell swiss company million time garsik tell shareholder final stage testing product cure baldness formula swiss announce ray claire think harmless lotion turn disappoint impress completely manipulate thank bottle champagne tully

Harbanslal is sure that within these ice-capped mountains lies an entire temple made of pure gold.

Princess Kaiulani,biopic,"At Iolani Palace, Princess Kaiulani and the rest of the royal family prepare for a ceremony that night to light Honolulu with only electricity. That night however the ceremony is interrupted when a large group of armed white men enter the palace grounds. Led by Lorrin Thurston, the men demand that Ka'iulani's uncle, King Kalakaua, sign a new constitution to restrict the power of the monarchy as well as to grant huge governmental powers to citizens of European ancestry. The situation soon devolves into a tense standoff between Thurston's men and the Royal Guards. Amidst the chaos of the moment Ka'iulani is taken away for her own safety by her Scottish father, Archie Cleghorn, and sent to England for both protection and education.
Now in England, Ka'iulani struggles to fit in as her Polynesian heritage makes her a target of racism and offensive stereotypes from the Europeans whom she meets. She does make some friends, including the handsome young Clive Davies. They develop a relationship and the two become engaged. But one day her father returns from Hawaii after several years and, to her shock, informs her that her uncle, King Kalakaua, had died shortly after being forced to sign the new constitution by Thurston and Sanford B. Dole. He then informs her that a failed native rebellion against the new constitution gave Thurston enough support to arrest and depose Queen Liliuokalani, overthrowing the monarchy and declaring Hawai'i a republic. After discovering that the Davies family knew of her family's overthrow but hid the news from her Ka'iulani decides to call off her engagement and leave England. She travels to the United States where she gathers media attention and denounces the overthrow as well as the U.S.'s involvement. Her cultured, regal appearance overcomes the racist views against her, and many note that she is not the ""Barbarian Princess"" she was depicted as at all. Her campaign against the overthrow climaxes with her meeting U.S. President Grover Cleveland. At a lunch with the President, Ka'iulani charms him and convinces him to actively oppose the overthrow, which he does so by refusing to annex Hawaii as an American territory. Unfortunately for Ka'ilulani, this act is done during the waning days of the Cleveland administration, and a few weeks later President William McKinley is inaugurated.
When Ka'iulani returns to Hawaiʻi, she learns the new president has not only failed to oppose the overthrow but has also accepted Thurston's annexation proposal, annexing Hawaii as a territory of the United States of America. She attends a small private funeral for the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, hosted by her aunt, Queen Liliuokalani. Shortly after her return, she is visited by Sanford B. Dole, who explains that three U.S. legal commissioners are arriving, and that he and Thurston would like the Princess to host a small dinner for them. Though she is appalled at the impertinent request, he convinces her that it might be to her advantage too. At the dinner, Ka'iulani charms her visitors before surprising Thurston by publicly petitioning for an amendment to the annexation treaty to guarantee universal suffrage and voting rights to all Native Hawaiians. She is disregarded by an appalled Thurston, who points out she is not a recognized diplomat before Dole stands up for the princess and declares he will petition the amendment for her. As the amendment gathers support amongst the dinner guests, Thurston leaves, embarrassed and angry.
After the dinner, Ka'iulani is surprised to learn that her former fiancee Clive has come to Hawaiʻi, as he had promised he would, and she goes to see him. He tells her that his father has passed and he is now in charge of his assets, including those in Hawaii. The two make up, and Clive asks Ka'iulani to return to England and marry him. She refuses, stating that her future is in Hawaii. When he equally refuses to move to Hawaii, the two share a last farewell kiss before Clive leaves for England. The film ends with Ka'iulani returning her treasured seashells, which she had kept throughout her travels to remind her of Hawaiʻi, back to the ocean as she wades in the waves, with a voiceover saying that the bright flame of Ka'iulani is kept alive by the love of her people. A post-credits card shows that Ka'iulani died less than one year after annexation, some say of a broken heart for the loss of her kingdom. Another card mentions that in 1993 President Clinton signed the Apology Resolution, apologizing to Hawaiʻi for the role the U.S. played in the overthrow.",biopic iolani palace princess kaiulani rest royal family prepare ceremony night light honolulu electricity night ceremony interrupt large group armed white man enter palace ground lead lorrin thurston man demand uncle king kalakaua sign new constitution restrict power monarchy grant huge governmental power citizen european ancestry situation soon devolve tense standoff thurston man royal guard amidst chaos moment take away safety scottish father archie cleghorn send england protection education england struggle fit polynesian heritage make target racism offensive stereotype europeans meet friend include handsome young clive davy develop relationship engaged day father return hawaii year shock inform uncle king kalakaua die shortly force sign new constitution thurston sanford dole inform fail native rebellion new constitution give thurston support arrest depose queen liliuokalani overthrow monarchy declare republic discover davy family know family overthrow hide news decide engagement leave england travel united states gather media attention denounce overthrow involvement cultured regal appearance overcome racist view note barbarian princess depict campaign overthrow climax meeting president grover cleveland lunch president charm convince actively oppose overthrow refuse annex hawaii american territory unfortunately act wane day cleveland administration week later president william mckinley inaugurate return hawaiʻi learn new president fail oppose overthrow accept thurston annexation proposal annex hawaii territory united states america attend small private funeral kingdom hawaiʻi host aunt queen liliuokalani shortly return visit sanford dole explain legal commissioner arrive thurston like princess host small dinner appal impertinent request convince advantage dinner charm visitor surprising thurston publicly petition amendment annexation treaty guarantee universal suffrage voting right native hawaiian disregard appalled thurston point recognize diplomat dole stand princess declare petition amendment amendment gather support dinner guest thurston leave embarrassed angry dinner surprised learn fiancee clive come hawaiʻi promise go tell father pass charge asset include hawaii clive ask return england marry refuse state future hawaii equally refuse hawaii share farewell kiss clive leave england film end return treasured seashell keep travel remind hawaiʻi ocean wade wave voiceover say bright flame keep alive love people post credit card show die year annexation broken heart loss kingdom card mention president clinton sign apology resolution apologize hawaiʻi role play overthrow

Flywheel,drama,"Jay Austin (Alex Kendrick) is a car salesman who consistently cheats his customers, even to the point of overcharging his own pastor. He teaches his rotund salesmen, Bernie Meyers (Tracy Goode) and Vince Berkeley (Treavor Lokey), to do likewise. Jay occasionally attends church, but only because his wife Judy (Janet Lee Dapper) wants him to go. He also fakes giving a donation to the church. His relationships with his wife and son (Richie Hunnewell), who both disapprove of his dishonesty, deteriorate. In addition he is facing foreclosure on his lot by the bank. Jay becomes troubled in his conscience, and one day while flipping television channels, he sees a pastor preaching that ""you're in the shape you're in today because of the choices you've made."" Jay becomes personally convicted and becomes a born-again Christian, prompting him to change his business practices.
Jay apologizes to his pregnant wife and his son and decides to sell cars honestly from that point on. However, he is now thousands of dollars in debt and facing the loss of his dealership if he can't catch up on his payments to the bank. Jay decides not to worry about his situation and to ""let God handle it,"" telling the Lord that it is His lot. After the two rotund salesmen, whose interactions often provide comedy, leave over a disagreement about the newly reformed business practices, a young, innocent-looking ""newcomer"" Kevin Cantrell (Daniel Titus) comes to Jay to work for six weeks and asks him questions, such as how he sells cars. Jay answers by saying, ""Just sell the car to them by its real price and God will decide."" Sales are honest, but the amounts are mediocre at best. Kevin leaves after the six weeks, but later Jay sees himself on television as part of a news investigation on car dealerships. Kevin was a carefully concealed undercover agent investigating which car dealers cheat, and the report says that Jay Austin Motors was the only honest dealership among them. The next day Jay comes to the lot and sees many people there to buy his cars. Jay even has to call his wife to help sell all the cars on the lot that day. The total of the sales above the cost of the cars is enough to cover what the banker demanded, who comes later that day and wonders where all the cars have gone.
Business continues to be brisk, and then Jay begins to feel convicted in his conscience about his dishonesty during the prior two years that he had been in business, and with his wife's encouragement decides to make restitution to all the customers he had overcharged. He also finds that the amount due them was the same as the profit he had after expenses and salaries.
Shortly thereafter, Jay is asked to do another live television interview, this time from reporter Hillary Vale (Lisa Arnold) of WALB-TV. On camera, Jay sees his now former employee Bernie saying that Jay Austin is a cheater, leading Hillary to say viewers will have to make up their own mind. However, many of his old customers (presumably all seeing the news) to whom Jay had just made restitution wasted no time to visit the lot to tell Hillary that there is more to the story. Hillary broadcasts an update 30 minutes after the prior live newscast to reflect the lot's new visitations. At home Jay's wife and son, who had been praying for Jay since the first report, also see this latest development on television, and then his wife starts to feel contractions. Jay exits the lot and rushes home to bring his wife to the hospital. She gives birth to a girl named Faith, to stand as a living reminder of Jay's newfound faith in God. At the end of the film, Jay drives away with his son in his 1958 Triumph TR3, an acquisition at the beginning of the film, which Max (Walter Burnett), his mechanic, had repaired with a newly installed flywheel (thus the film's title).",drama jay austin alex kendrick car salesman consistently cheat customer point overcharge pastor teach rotund salesman bernie meyer tracy goode vince berkeley treavor lokey likewise jay occasionally attend church wife judy janet lee dapper want fake give donation church relationship wife son richie hunnewell disapprove dishonesty deteriorate addition face foreclosure lot bank jay troubled conscience day flip television channel see pastor preach shape today choice jay personally convict bear christian prompt change business practice jay apologize pregnant wife son decide sell car honestly point thousand dollar debt face loss dealership catch payment bank jay decide worry situation let god handle tell lord lot rotund salesman interaction provide comedy leave disagreement newly reform business practice young innocent look newcomer kevin cantrell daniel titus come jay work week ask question sell car jay answer say sell car real price god decide sale honest amount mediocre well kevin leave week later jay see television news investigation car dealership kevin carefully conceal undercover agent investigate car dealer cheat report say jay austin motors honest dealership day jay come lot see people buy car jay wife help sell car lot day total sale cost car cover banker demand come later day wonder car go business continue brisk jay begin feel convict conscience dishonesty prior year business wife encouragement decide restitution customer overcharge find profit expense salary shortly jay ask live television interview time reporter hillary vale lisa arnold walb tv camera jay see employee bernie say jay austin cheater lead hillary viewer mind old customer presumably see news jay restitution waste time visit lot tell hillary story hillary broadcast update minute prior live newscast reflect lot new visitation home jay wife son pray jay report late development television wife start feel contraction jay exit lot rush home bring wife hospital give birth girl name faith stand living reminder jay newfound faith god end film jay drive away son triumph acquisition beginning film max walter burnett mechanic repair newly instal flywheel film title
Fifty Shades Darker,"drama, romance","After Anastasia Steele leaves Christian Grey, he has nightmares about his abusive childhood. Meanwhile, Ana begins a new job as an assistant to Jack Hyde, an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP) whose previous three assistants all quit within the last 18 months. Ana unexpectedly runs into Christian at the opening of her friend Jose Rodriguez's photography exhibit. She is dismayed that Christian bought all of Jose's portraits of Ana. Christian wants Ana back and agrees to her no rules, no punishments, and no more secrets terms.
As Jack and Ana head for an after-work drink, Ana is approached on the street by a young woman resembling her. Christian arrives at the bar and acts coolly towards Jack, then quickly departs with Ana. Ana dismisses Christian's warning about Jack's reputations. She is annoyed that Christian is considering buying Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP). Jack tells Ana he expects her to accompany him on a New York book expo trip, but after speaking with Christian, she agrees not to attend.
Shortly after, Ana again notices the same woman observing her and Christian from a distance. Christian deflects Ana's inquiry about the woman's identity, but later admits she is Leila Williams, a former submissive. After their contract ended, Leila wanted more, but Christian ended the relationship. Leila married a man who later died, causing Leila to have a mental breakdown. She has been stalking Ana and Christian.
Prior to the Grey family's annual charity ball, Christian takes Ana to Esclava, a beauty salon owned by Elena Lincoln. Elena is Christian's former dominant who introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle. Ana is furious that Christian took her there and that Elena and Christian are business partners. At the ball, Christian's sister mentions that her brother was expelled from four different schools for brawling. Christian tells Ana that his mother committed suicide; he was alone with her body for three days before being taken to the hospital where Grace Trevelyan Grey worked; she cared for and later adopted the young boy. During the ball, Ana rebuffs Elena's demand that she leave Christian and warns Elena to stay away. Arriving home, she and Christian discover Leila has vandalized Ana's car. Christian later tells Ana that his birth mother was a crack-addicted prostitute.
When Ana tells Jack she won't be attending the expo with him, he attempts to seduce her while they are alone at work, but she evades him and escapes. Christian exerts his influence to have Jack fired, and Ana is promoted to acting editor in Jack's place. Christian asks Ana to move in with him and she agrees.
At Ana's apartment, Leila threatens her with a gun. Christian and his driver/bodyguard, Jason Taylor, enter and Christian controls Leila by becoming her dominant. Ana, seeing Christian's need to be dominant, leaves, returning hours later. Christian is furious but Ana needs time to consider their relationship. Christian submissively drops to his knees and confesses that he is not a dominant, but a sadist who enjoyed hurting women who looked like his birth mother. He insists he wants to change. Christian later proposes but Ana needs time before accepting.
Christian leaves on a business trip, piloting his own helicopter. An engine failure occurs over Mt. St. Helens, forcing him to ditch the craft in a heavily forested area. A massive search and rescue ensues. As Ana and Christian's family await news, Christian arrives home safely. Ana, realizing she loves him, accepts his marriage proposal.
At Christian's birthday party, Elena accuses Ana of being a gold digger. Ana orders her to stop interfering. Christian overhears and dismissively tells Elena that she taught him, ""how to fuck"" while Ana taught him ""how to love."" Grace overhears the conversation and demands Elena leave for good; Christian also cuts all ties with Elena. Later that evening, Christian proposes to Ana, this time with a ring, and she accepts. As fireworks erupt in the sky, Jack Hyde watches the festivities from afar, silently swearing revenge against Christian and Ana.",drama romance anastasia steele leave christian grey nightmare abusive childhood ana begin new job assistant jack hyde editor seattle independent publishing sip previous assistant quit month ana unexpectedly run christian opening friend jose rodriguez photography exhibit dismay christian buy jose portrait ana christian want ana agree rule punishment secret term jack ana head work drink ana approach street young woman resemble christian arrive bar act coolly jack quickly depart ana ana dismiss christian warning jack reputation annoyed christian consider buy seattle independent publishing sip jack tell ana expect accompany new york book expo trip speak christian agree attend shortly ana notice woman observe christian distance christian deflect ana inquiry woman identity later admit leila williams submissive contract end leila want christian end relationship leila marry man later die cause leila mental breakdown stalk ana christian prior grey family annual charity ball christian take ana esclava beauty salon own elena lincoln elena christian dominant introduce bdsm lifestyle ana furious christian take elena christian business partner ball christian sister mention brother expel different school brawl christian tell ana mother commit suicide body day take hospital grace trevelyan grey work care later adopt young boy ball ana rebuff elena demand leave christian warn elena stay away arrive home christian discover leila vandalize ana car christian later tell ana birth mother crack addict prostitute ana tell jack will attend expo attempt seduce work evade escape christian exert influence jack fire ana promote act editor jack place christian ask ana agree ana apartment leila threaten gun christian driver bodyguard jason taylor enter christian control leila dominant ana see christian need dominant leave return hour later christian furious ana need time consider relationship christian submissively drop knee confess dominant sadist enjoyed hurt woman look like birth mother insist want change christian later propose ana need time accept christian leave business trip pilot helicopter engine failure occur mt st helens force ditch craft heavily forest area massive search rescue ensue ana christian family await news christian arrive home safely ana realize love accept marriage proposal christian birthday party elena accuse ana gold digger ana order stop interfere christian overhear dismissively tell elena teach fuck ana teach love grace overhear conversation demand elena leave good christian cut tie elena later evening christian propose ana time ring accept firework erupt sky jack hyde watch festivity afar silently swear revenge christian ana

Astro Boy,animated film,"Toby Tenma is a 13 year old teenage boy who lives in the futuristic city-state Metro City, which floats above the polluted ""Surface"". Toby's father, Dr. Tenma, is a famous roboticist and head of the Ministry of Science, but has a distant relationship with his son. Dr. Tenma meets the city's obstructive leader President Stone to demonstrate a new defensive robot called the Peacekeeper. To power it, Tenma's friend Dr. Elefun unveils the Blue and Red Core, two energy spheres which have opposing positive and negative energy. Stone places the destructive Red Core into the Peacekeeper (against the doctors' warnings not to), causing it to go berserk, leading to Toby being disintegrated after sneaking into the room.
A distraught Tenma secretly constructs a robotic replica of Toby, complete with his memories, but has built-in defenses to protect him and is powered by the Blue Core. Toby's replica is awakened, believing nothing has happened. While he has Toby's mind, his personality is different in Tenma's eyes, when in actuality it is quite similar. Toby discovers his robotic capabilities including rocket-powered flight and the ability to understand other robots. Toby flies home but learns from Tenma of his origins and is rejected by him, flying away much to the sadness of Dr. Elefun. Stone, desperate to win a re-election, has Toby pursued by his guards but the battle leads to Toby tumbling off the city edge onto the Surface when one of Stone's ships blast him with missiles. Tenma and Elefun are not arrested when Tenma agrees to have Toby shut down.
Toby awakens in an enormous junkyard, created from the redundant robots dumped by Metro City. He is found by a group of human children, illiterate but smart Zane, twins Sludge and Widget, and the oldest Cora who has a grudge against Metro City. They are accompanied by a dog-like waste disposal robot named Trashcan. Toby also meets the members of the Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF), Sparx, Robotsky, and Mike the Fridge, who wish to free robots from mankind's control but are very inept and bound by the Laws of Robotics. However, they give Toby a new name, calling him ""Astro"". Astro departs with the kids, finding people still live on the Surface. He is taken in by robot repairman Hamegg, who also runs a robot fighting ring. The next day, Astro comes across an offline construction robot Zog, whom he revives with the Blue Core's energy. Hamegg accidentally scans Astro, realizing he is a robot, and paralyzes him the next day to participate in the fighting ring.
Astro defeats Hamegg's fighters until Zog is deployed, but the two robots refuse to fight one another. Hamegg assaults them with an electrical blaster, only for Zog to attempt to harm him, immune from the Laws of Robotics, but Astro saves Hamegg. President Stone's flagship arrives and Astro is taken back to Metro City, leaving Hamegg to be booed by the Crowd. Reuniting with Tenma and Elefun, Astro agrees to be shut down, apologizing to his father for not being a better Toby. Realizing Astro is still his son, Dr. Tenma reactivates him and lets him escape. Stone loads the Red Core into the Peacekeeper, only for it to absorb him and take on his personality. The Peacekeeper absorbs weapons and buildings, growing in size until it's the height of skyscrapers. It then goes on a rampage across Metro City, prompting Astro to battle it. During the fight, Metro City's power station is destroyed, causing it to fall to the ground. Astro uses his superhuman strength to help it land safely.
The Peacekeeper grabs Astro, but the connection of their cores causes them both pain. Dr. Tenma finds Astro and informs him that if the two cores reunite, they will be destroyed. When Astro's friends are captured, he flies into the Red Core, destroying the Peacekeeper and breaking his arm, but remaining mostly intact. Stone survives but is arrested for his crimes. Dr. Elefun and the children find Astro's body, discovering the Blue Core is dead. Zog appears and revives Astro using the Blue Core energy given to him. Astro reunites with his loved ones, making peace with his father.

Contraband,action thriller,"Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) is an ex-smuggler who now has a peaceful life with his wife, Kate (Kate Beckinsale), and their two sons in New Orleans. They learn that Kate's brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) was smuggling drugs, but dropped them into the Mississippi River during a surprise inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Andy's boss, mobster Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi), threatens to kill Chris' family if Andy doesn't pay him back $700,000. Chris decides to raise the money by running contraband, working with his former smuggling partner, Sebastian Abney (Ben Foster), who now owns a legitimate construction company. Promising Kate he will not run drugs, Chris joins a cargo ship, planning to buy $10,000,000 in fake bills in Panama and smuggle them into the U.S. He is joined by Andy, his good friend Danny Raymer (Lukas Haas), and gets help from crew mates. After Briggs breaks into Chris' house and intimidates his wife and children, Kate moves into Sebastian's house for safety.
In Panama, Chris discovers that the only one who can provide high quality fake bills is crime lord Gonzalo (Diego Luna). Leaving Andy in the van with the money for the fake bills, Chris meets with Gonzalo to negotiate. Briggs calls Andy, threatens to kill one of Chris' sons and forces him to take the money and buy cocaine. With the money gone, Chris and Danny agree to help Gonzalo rob an armored car in exchange for the fake bills. After a shootout in which Gonzalo's group along with numerous police and security officers get killed, they successfully steal a Jackson Pollock painting that resembles a splattered tarp. Chris and Danny barely make it back to the ship with the fake bills and the painting. They drive the van with contraband into a container, which is loaded onto their cargo ship. Chris hits and berates Andy for using the money to buy cocaine, but apologizes when Andy explains the reason.
It is revealed that Sebastian is working with Briggs, and he desperately needs money to pay gangster Jim Church (David O'Hara). Sebastian calls Chris and learns that Chris plans to get rid of the cocaine Andy bought. Sebastian instructs Briggs to threaten Kate. Through Kate, Briggs warns Chris not to dump the cocaine. Chris realizes that Sebastian has betrayed him. Sebastian contacts the cargo ship's Captain Camp (J. K. Simmons), with whom he has a partnership. He tells Camp of Chris' smuggled contraband, and promises him a share if he secures it. Unable to get Chris to give up the contraband, Camp calls U.S. Customs to inspect the ship in New Orleans. The Customs agents find the container with Chris' van, which is empty except for the paint splattered tarp, which they ignore.
Once Chris is on shore, Briggs and his thugs demand the drug package. Chris takes Briggs to Camp's house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and knowingly activates the security system. Chris opens Camp's carpet cleaner and retrieves the cocaine from it. While Briggs and his gang sit in Camp's living room with the cocaine, Chris sneaks out. Camp awakens to the noise and comes into the living room as the police arrive. Both Briggs's group and Camp are arrested for possession of the cocaine.
Warned by Chris, Kate leaves Sebastian's house. When she goes back to retrieve some personal items, Sebastian gets angry with her and accidentally pushes her against a bathtub. Thinking she is dead, he dumps her (unconscious) body in a yet to be poured foundation at one of his construction sites. Chris goes to Sebastian's construction site and manages to locate and save Kate by calling her cellphone. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison, where he is greeted by a lynch mob.
Danny retrieves the fake bills, which were dumped into the Mississippi River by Chris before docking in New Orleans. At a U.S. Customs auction, Andy buys the escape van earlier confiscated from the cargo ship, and finds the painting still in it. Church pays Chris $3 million for the fake currency and asks about the missing Jackson Pollock. Chris learns the painting can be fenced for over $20 million on the black market.

 Rat Race,comedy,"Donald Sinclair, the eccentric owner of The Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, devises a new game to entertain the high rollers who visit his hotel. Six special tokens are placed in the casino's slot machines, and the winners are told that $2 million in cash is hidden in a duffel bag in a train station locker in Silver City, New Mexico, 563 miles southeast of Las Vegas. Each team is given a key to the locker and told to race to the train station to claim the money. Unbeknownst to the competitors, Sinclair's wealthy patrons are placing bets on who will win. The patrons continue making smaller bets throughout the film, facilitated by Sinclair's assistant Grisham, who at one point hires an escort as part of a dare.
Among the racers are scheming siblings Duane and Blaine Cody, businesswoman Merrill Jennings and her estranged mother Vera, disgraced American football referee Owen Templeton, the Pear family led by opportunistic father Randy, eccentric Italian tourist Enrico Pollini, and no-nonsense Nick Schaffer.
Unable to get on the earliest flight, Duane and Blaine manage to destroy the airport radar with their Ford Bronco, grounding everybody else. However their vehicle is wrecked in the sabotage, so they steal another. The brothers decide to split up and create a replica key to double their chances of winning. The locksmith overhears their plan and makes off with the key in a hot air balloon. Duane and Blaine catch up to him, leaving the locksmith and a stray dairy cow hanging from the balloon's anchor rope. The brothers later steal a monster truck and continue towards Silver City.
Merrill and Vera crash their car after being given malicious road directions. They steal a rocket car, which races across the desert until it runs out of fuel. The women dizzily stumble onto a bus full of mental patients which eventually drives toward Silver City.
Owen masquerades as the driver of a bus filled with Lucille Ball impersonators going to an I Love Lucy convention. Outside Silver City, the bus hits the cow dangling from the hot air balloon and swerves off the road. Owen has an emotional breakdown, reveals he is not the bus driver, and is forced to flee from the women on foot. Owen eventually rides a stolen horse to Silver City.
Randy Pear deceives his family into accompanying him in the race, stating that it is a business trip. The family mistakenly visits a museum dedicated to the Nazi Klaus Barbie. After the Cody brothers vandalize their vehicle, the Pears steal Adolf Hitler's staff car to continue. Randy declines to end the trip when his family becomes tired of traveling. He eventually tells them about the $2 million, and they are initially excited. However, when his family insists on ending the trip again, he drugs them with sleeping pills and bundles them into a semi-truck to reach Silver City.
Nick chooses not to participate in the race until he meets pilot Tracy Faucet, who gives him an advantage as she is one of the few still able to fly, using her non-fixed-wing helicopter. The helicopter stalls after Tracy uses it to attack her cheating boyfriend. The two then steal his truck to continue the race.
Narcoleptic Enrico falls asleep at the start of the race and only awakens hours later. He receives a ride from an ambulance driver, Zack, who is delivering a transplant heart to El Paso. Enrico eventually boards a train heading to Silver City.
The racers reunite in Silver City and tackle each other to open the locker, only to find it is empty. Outside, they find Sinclair's assistant Grisham and the call girl he hired making off with the money bag. They lose it when the locksmith ties it to the balloon, only for the three to crash their car.
The racers follow the balloon until it lands at an outdoor charity concert hosted by Smash Mouth. The band and crowd mistake the money as a donation, and once they see the charitable good spirit they have made, the group are persuaded to accept. Nick surprises a horrified Sinclair and his patrons by declaring to the audience that the gamblers will match the amount of money already raised.

Idlewild,crime,"Percival (Andre 3000) and Rooster (Big Boi) have been good friends since childhood. However, as they grow up, they each begin to live separate lives. Percival works at his father Percy Senior's (Vereen) morgue during the day, and works at a local club called Church at night playing the piano. Rooster becomes a singer at the club and a bootlegger; he also gets married to Zora (Williams), with whom he has five children.
One night when Rooster shows up late to the club, everyone becomes upset and rowdy including gangsters Spats (Rhames), Trumpy (Howard), Ace (Love) and Rose (Paula Jai Parker) who have a business deal with the club and Rooster. Finally Rooster shows up and performs; Rooster, Spats, Trumpy and Ace talk about their deal. Spats wishes to get out of the business, and is willing to sell out to Ace. Meanwhile, backstage, a singer from St. Louis named Angel Davenport (Paula Patton) comes into the club and starts to complain about her train ride and her contract with the club. Angel is actually an imposter; she is really an aspiring singer named Sally B. Shelley, who stole the contract from the real Davenport (Labelle).
Rooster and Rose have sex in a car in a warehouse until they hear people coming into the warehouse, Rose jumps out of the car, gets dressed and confronts Spats, Trumpy and Ace who have just arrived. Rose then runs off, Trumpy then shoots and kills Spats and Ace in order to get the business for himself.
Meanwhile, Rooster runs into Trumpy while taking his family shopping and Trumpy explains that the debt owed by Ace is now his problem. He has to come up with this money by selling liquor at Church bought from Trumpy's ""suppliers"". Rooster goes to Rose's house to warn her, but she is already packed up and ready to leave. As Rose drives away in a taxi, she is being watched by one of Trumpy's henchmen.
Meanwhile, Rooster begins to have more problems at the club, and forces Angel to sing. Angel has an attack of stage fright, but Percival calms her by giving her a song that he wrote for her. The song is a hit, and Angel becomes an overnight star; she and Percival also fall in love. During a storm, Angel runs over to the morgue to be with Percival, and the two have sex.
Roosters's wife Zora gets tired of his cheating and moves with their children to her mother's house. Angel gets a record deal in Chicago and asks Percival to go with her, but he reluctantly declines, as he feels obligated to his father. When Angel finds out that Percival knows who she really is, however, she pledges her love to him and persuades him to go to Chicago with her.
Rooster devises a plan to buy liquor from bootlegger GW (Nunn) and his partner. One day, Rooster is making his rounds to pick up hooch from GW to load in a hearse borrowed from Percival, when he sees a car on the road that seems to be stuck. He approaches the car to see an old woman, Mother Hopkins (Tyson), and her grandchildren. Mother Hopkins tells Rooster that he is an angel and gives him a bible. Rooster walks into the old abandoned house of the two bootleggers and sees that Trumpy's henchmen have beaten up GW and killed his partner.
Rooster is caught and brought to Trumpy, and GW is shot and killed. There is a fight between Rooster and Trumpy's henchmen. Rooster is shot but not killed due to the bible in his jacket and drives away in the hearse. However, Trumpy pursues him and shoots at him.

What's the Worst That Could Happen?,comedy,"Kevin Caffrey, a thief and connoisseur is at a local auction looking for things worth stealing. He meets Amber Belhaven who is auctioning off her father's painting to pay a hotel bill. When Kevin asks Amber about her hotel room which leads to Amber asking if he was trying to sleep with her, Kevin blinks rapidly and lies while also telling her that when he blinks he lies. When Kevin asks Amber if he could see her sometime Amber pretends to have the same thing Kevin has and says yes. While knowing what hotel she was staying in, he shows up to her room with the painting she auctioned off, having stolen it. Kevin tells Amber about his stealing business which shocks Amber at first but she accepts it in order to be with Kevin, and she later gives Kevin her father's lucky ring.
Elsewhere, Max Fairbanks, a snarky businessman whose company, TUI, is going into bankruptcy, is going over with his lawyer Walter Greenbaum on how to save his company. Walter is exhausted as Max does not take the proceeding seriously and still spends freely even asking to declare bankruptcy immediately without trying to budget so his assets are protected. He tells his wife Lutetia Fairbanks that his company is in a technical procedure to disguise what his company is really going into. Kevin goes to a local bar which his Uncle Jack owns to see Amber. Whilst inside he also runs into his friend Berger, who is also a thief and happens to know what places to hit. While having Kevin going outside to tell him about Max Fairbanks, he shows him an article about Max's current situation with his company, as well as what he couldn't access due to the critical condition of the chapter 11 bankruptcy code which includes going into his beachfront mansion.
Kevin and Berger go to the house to rob it, but Max captures Kevin. Before the police take Kevin away, Max spots Amber's ring and tells the police that the ring was also stolen. Kevin is forced to hand over the ring. After escaping from the police, Kevin returns to the beach house to get his ring back from Max, but fails to find him. Angry at Max, Kevin finishes off what he started by robbing Max of the valuables inside the house and one of Max's three cars outside. Kevin tells Amber that the ring was stolen from him.
The next day an exasperated Walter informs Max he was banned from his summer house, and his being there breached the terms of his bankruptcy. Max flippantly says he'll be fine as the ring is his lucky charm. Meanwhile, Kevin and Berger hire Shelly Nix, a computer hacker, to track Max's whereabouts by hacking into his e-mail. During an airplane flight, Max talks to his associate Gloria, a psychic, about the ring. Gloria consults her cards, and draws a king with five daggers on his head. Shocked at the result, Gloria doesn't tell Max what she drew and pretends that her phone connection is breaking up. Max meets a judge that he thought he paid off to keep his house, but his insults lead to the judge ordering him to sell his house and his contents at a public auction.
Upon knowing Max's plan to go to a cocktail party and then head to his beach house for one final visit, Kevin and Berger, with the help of their partners Windham and Edwina, rob another one of Max's houses. The next morning Max finds out that his house has been robbed and meets with Detective Alex Tardio of the Robbery Division. Having enough of Kevin stealing from him, he calls his head of security, Earl Redburn.
Kevin finds out from Shelly that Max is going to Washington, D.C., for a Senate hearing and has an apartment there. Kevin and Berger go to Washington to try and rob Max's apartment. There, Kevin learns that Max intends to secretly bribe the senators, and replaces the bribe money with insulting notes in Max's name. Max and Earl later storm into the apartment, having deduced Kevin's presence there. In the ensuing scuffle, Kevin tries to steal back the ring, but instead steals Max's wedding ring. Afterwards, Amber decides that Kevin's feud with Max has gone too far and that she no longer cares about the ring. While Max later addresses the Senate Committee he gets a call from Kevin who tells him that if Max will give him his ring back he will give him back his. Max refuses and proceeds to repeatedly curse at Kevin. To the senators, and other viewers, it appears he is speaking to them, with the result being that the hearing ends very badly for Max. While going back to his apartment in Philadelphia, Walter quits as his lawyer and Earl tells him that he was hacked; Max tells Earl his plan to get Kevin once and for all.
Kevin goes to Jack to find out where Amber is; Jack tells Kevin to stop robbing Max out of personal conflict and to forget about the ring. But when Berger tells Kevin about Max's bankruptcy auction and for how much his auction full of valuables is worth, Jack wants in on it too. Max gets a call from Lutetia about Max's behavior on TV, and tells him not to come home, while Amber breaks up with Kevin due to his obsession with Max and the ring. Lutetia finds Amber at Jack's bar wearing a jacket of hers that Kevin stole from their house and confronts her, Amber tells her that Max stole the ring she gave to Kevin. Knowing that they are both in the same situation, they come up with a plan.
Gloria, thinking about Max, still draws the same card and decides to come clean. Noticing how bad it is, she tells him to put an end to it, but Max still refuses to give up Kevin's ring. Realizing Max's arrogant determination to keep the ring, she quits being his associate, and goes to Tardio to give him Max's company records.
At the bankruptcy auction, Lutetia tells Max that she wishes him well and sends him a masseuse. While Earl keeps looking out for Kevin through his monitors, Berger, Jack, Windham, and Edwina set their scheme in motion. Edwina and Windham are disguised as waiters, with the real waiters bound and gagged in their truck. Berger is disguised as the auctioneer, while Jack is his associate, having tied up and gagged the original auctioneer. Shelly hacks into Max's security system. The crooks steal as much as they can, and later flee. Windham plants smoke bombs to obscure their escape and calls the fire brigade. At 2:00 Shelly plants a video of Kevin delivering a message to Max that he was being robbed without him being there on Earl's monitors.
Angry and enraged, Max goes out into the smoke to find Kevin, but a firefighter, actually Kevin in disguise, drags him out of the smoke, stealing the ring in the process. Kevin steals Max's boat to escape, but Max jumps onto the boat and struggles with Kevin to get back the ring. While hitting a buoy, causing the boat to sink, Kevin and Max find out that the ring is a fake, the ring having an inscription inside it that said: ""Grow up."" a message that they both got from their lovers. Max realises that Lutetia had induced the masseuse to steal the ring during his massage. When Tardio finds Max and Kevin, Kevin tells Tardio that he was saving Max, while Max corroborates his story, telling Tardio that he had never met Kevin. Kevin thanks Max and tells him that he owes him one. While going back to the hotel where Amber used to be before she moved in with Kevin, she shows him the ring, revealing that she was the masseuse. She tells Kevin that the ring had bad luck and that he should throw it away. Kevin agrees and flings the ring out of sight and gets back together with Amber. Kevin, pretending to be Max's lawyer, fixes the Senate hearing and goes into the press conference victorious. When it is over Max and Kevin part ways, but as they do so, Kevin steals one of Max's watches.",comedy kevin caffrey thief connoisseur local auction look thing worth steal meet amber belhaven auction father painting pay hotel bill kevin ask amber hotel room lead amber ask try sleep kevin blink rapidly lie tell blink lie kevin ask amber amber pretend thing kevin say yes know hotel stay show room painting auction having steal kevin tell amber steal business shock amber accept order kevin later give kevin father lucky ring max fairbank snarky businessman company tui go bankruptcy go lawyer walter greenbaum save company walter exhaust max proceeding seriously spend freely ask declare bankruptcy immediately try budget asset protect tell wife lutetia fairbank company technical procedure disguise company go kevin go local bar uncle jack own amber whilst inside run friend berger thief happen know place hit have kevin go outside tell max fairbank show article max current situation company access critical condition chapter bankruptcy code include go beachfront mansion kevin berger house rob max captures kevin police kevin away max spot amber ring tell police ring steal kevin force hand ring escape police kevin return beach house ring max fail find angry max kevin finish start rob max valuable inside house max car outside kevin tell amber ring steal day exasperate walter informs max ban summer house breach term bankruptcy max flippantly say fine ring lucky charm kevin berger hire shelly nix computer hacker track max whereabouts hack e mail airplane flight max talk associate gloria psychic ring gloria consult card draw king dagger head shock result gloria tell max draw pretend phone connection break max meet judge think pay house insult lead judge order sell house content public auction know max plan cocktail party head beach house final visit kevin berger help partner windham edwina rob max house morning max find house rob meet detective alex tardio robbery division have kevin steal call head security earl redburn kevin find shelly max go washington senate hearing apartment kevin berger washington try rob max apartment kevin learn max intend secretly bribe senator replace bribe money insult note max max earl later storm apartment having deduce kevin presence ensue scuffle kevin try steal ring instead steal max wedding ring amber decide kevin feud max go far long care ring max later address senate committee get kevin tell max ring max refuse proceed repeatedly curse kevin senator viewer appear speak result hearing end badly max go apartment philadelphia walter quit lawyer earl tell hack max tell earl plan kevin kevin go jack find amber jack tell kevin stop rob max personal conflict forget ring berger tell kevin max bankruptcy auction auction valuable worth jack want max get lutetia max behavior tv tell come home amber break kevin obsession max ring lutetia find amber jack bar wear jacket kevin steal house confront amber tell max steal ring give kevin know situation come plan gloria think max draw card decide come clean notice bad tell end max refuse kevin ring realize max arrogant determination ring quit associate go tardio max company record bankruptcy auction lutetia tell max wish send masseuse earl keep look kevin monitor berger jack windham edwina set scheme motion edwina windham disguise waiter real waiter bind gag truck berger disguise auctioneer jack associate having tie gag original auctioneer shelly hack max security system crook steal later flee windham plant smoke bomb obscure escape call fire brigade shelly plant video kevin deliver message max rob earl monitor angry enraged max go smoke find kevin firefighter actually kevin disguise drag smoke steal ring process kevin steals max boat escape max jump boat struggle kevin ring hit buoy cause boat sink kevin max find ring fake ring have inscription inside say grow message get lover max realise lutetia induce masseuse steal ring massage tardio find max kevin kevin tell tardio save max max corroborate story tell tardio meet kevin kevin thanks max tell owe go hotel amber move kevin show ring reveal masseuse tell kevin ring bad luck throw away kevin agree fling ring sight get amber kevin pretend max lawyer fix senate hearing go press conference victorious max kevin way kevin steal max watch

The Serpent and the Rainbow,horror,"In 1978, a Haitian man named Christophe mysteriously dies in a French missionary clinic, while outside a voodoo parade marches past his window. The next morning, Christophe is buried in a traditional Catholic funeral. A mysterious man dressed in a suit who was outside Christophe's hospital window on the night he died is in attendance. As the coffin is lowered into the ground, Christophe's eyes open and tears roll down his cheeks.
Seven years later, Harvard anthropologist Dennis Alan is in the Amazon rainforest studying rare herbs and medicines with a local shaman. He drinks a potion and experiences a hallucination of the same black man from Christophe's funeral, surrounded by corpses in a bottomless pit.
Back in Boston, Alan is approached by a pharmaceutical company looking to investigate a drug used in Haitian Vodou to create zombies. The company wants Alan to acquire the drug for use as a ""super anesthetic"". The corporation provides Alan with funding and sends him to Haiti, which is in the middle of a revolution. Alan's exploration in Haiti, assisted by Doctor Marielle, locates Christophe who is alive after having been buried seven years earlier. Alan is taken into custody, and the commander of the Tonton Macoute, Captain Dargent Peytraud–the same man from Christophe's funeral and Alan's vision in the Amazon–warns Alan to leave Haiti.
Continuing his investigation, Alan finds a local man, Mozart, who is reported to have knowledge of the procedure for creating the zombie drug. Alan pays Mozart for a sample, but Mozart sells him rat poison instead. After embarrassing Mozart in public, Alan convinces Mozart to show Alan how to produce the drug for a fee of $1,000. Alan is arrested again by the Tonton Macoutes, tortured, and dumped on a street with the message that he must leave Haiti or be killed. Alan still refuses to leave and meets with Mozart to create the drug.
Alan has a nightmare of Peytraud, revealed to be a bokor who turns enemies into zombies and steals their souls. When Alan wakes up, he is lying next to Christophe's sister who has been decapitated. The Tonton Macoutes enter, take photos, and frame Alan for murder. Peytraud tells Alan to leave the country and never return, lest he be convicted of the murder, executed, and then his soul stolen by Peytraud. He puts Alan on a plane, but Mozart sneaks onboard and gives Alan the zombie drug. Mozart asks Alan to tell people about him, so that Mozart can achieve international fame. Alan agrees and returns to Boston with his mission apparently completed.
At a celebration dinner, the wife of Alan's employer is possessed by Peytraud, who warns Alan of his own imminent death. Alan returns to Haiti, where his only ally, a houngan named Lucien Celine, is killed by Peytraud and Mozart is beheaded as a sacrifice for Peytraud's power. Alan is then sprayed with the zombie powder and dies; later, Peytraud steals Alan's body from a medical clinic before Alan's death can be reported to the US Embassy. Peytraud takes Alan to a graveyard where, helpless in his coffin, Alan sees that Peytraud has captured Marielle and will sacrifice her. Peytraud shows Alan Celine's soul in a canari. Alan is then buried alive with a tarantula to ""keep him company"". Waking up in his coffin a few hours later, Alan is rescued by Christophe who was also turned into a zombie by Peytraud.
Having escaped Peytraud's trap, Alan returns to the Tonton Macoute headquarters looking for Marielle. There, Alan defeats Peytraud and sends his soul to hell.

Mrs Brown,biopic," Several screens of text giving some background are shown before a bust is shown flying over a palace wall and shattering into countless pieces. The film shows the story of a bereaved Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) and her relationship with a Scottish servant, John Brown (Billy Connolly), and the subsequent uproar it provoked. Brown had been a trusted servant of Victoria's then deceased and beloved Prince Consort, Prince Albert; Victoria's Household thought Brown might help to ease an inconsolable Queen since the Prince Consort's death in 1861. In 1863, hoping to subtly coax the Queen toward resuming public life after years of seclusion, Mr Brown is summoned to court.
The plan succeeds a little too well for the servants' liking, especially Victoria's chief secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby (Geoffrey Palmer) and The Prince of Wales (David Westhead) as well as other members of the Royal family; the public, press and politicians soon come to resent Brown's perceived influence over the queen. Brown takes considerable liberties with court protocol, especially by addressing Her Majesty as ""woman"". He also quickly takes control over the Queen's daily activities, further aggravating the tensions between himself and the royal family and servants.
The moniker ""Mrs Brown"", used both at the time and in the film, implied an improper, and perhaps sexual, relationship. The film does not directly address the contemporary suspicions that the Queen and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married (see the article on Brown), though cartoons from the satirical magazine Punch are shown as being passed around in Parliament (only one of the cartoons is revealed to the camera, showing an empty throne, with the sceptre lying unhanded across it).
As a result of Victoria's virtual recluse, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland (something initially encouraged by Brown), her popularity begins failing and republican sentiment begins growing. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (Antony Sher) has a weakening hold over the House of Commons and a fear of rising anti-monarchical sentiment in the country. He convinces Brown to use his influence with the Queen to persuade her to return to the performance of her public duties, especially the speech from the throne at the impending opening of Parliament.
Brown is reluctant to do so, rightly fearing that Victoria will take this as a personal betrayal. When Brown urges Victoria to return to London and fulfill her public duties, an argument ensues. Feeling betrayed by Brown, the Queen becomes enraged. When Brown once again refers to her as ""woman"", she sharply rebukes him. Leaving the room, she turns to Ponsonby and Jenner requesting that they serve her needs, clearly reducing Mr Brown's contact and influence over her. Their relationship was never to be the same again.
The Queen's eventual acquiescence and her decision to return to public life eventually leads to a revitalization of her popularity and a resurgence in public support of the monarchy.
Brown continues to serve Queen Victoria until his death in 1883. In his final years, his duties become reduced to head of security. The palace staff has become weary of Brown's dogmatic ways and they mock and rebuke his security efforts as paranoid delusions. Finally, during a public event, a gun-wielding assassin appears out of the crowd leaping toward the royal family. An ever-vigilant Brown successfully thwarts the assassination attempt. At dinner the next evening, the Prince of Wales retells the story, bragging to their dinner companions that he had been the one to warn Brown of the assassin. Seeing through her son's bragging, the Queen announces instead that a special medal for bravery, the ""Devoted Service Medal,"" will be minted and awarded to Brown.
Some years later, Brown becomes gravely ill with pneumonia after chasing through the woods late at night searching for a possible intruder. Hearing of Brown's illness, the Queen visits his room and is visibly shaken to see her old friend so ill. Placing a cool damp cloth against Brown's fevered brow, she confesses that she has not been as good a friend as she might have been in recent years. It is clear that her apology is accepted by Brown. The pneumonia proves fatal for Brown and he passes away.
During his years of service, Brown had kept a diary and, upon his passing, Ponsonby and Dr. Jenner discuss its contents stating that it must never be seen by anyone. Holding the diary at his side, Ponsonby walks away and it's implied that the diary will be destroyed or will disappear.
Dr. Jenner also reveals that the Prince of Wales has hurled the Queen's favourite bust of Brown up and over the palace wall, referencing the film's opening sequence.

Chasing Amy,comedy,"Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) are comic book artists and lifelong friends. They meet fellow comic book artist Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) at a comic book convention in New York City, where they are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to Alyssa, but soon learns that she is a lesbian. The two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops. Eventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship.
This new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who hates and mistrusts Alyssa and is disturbed by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, and he reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which gave her the nickname ""Finger Cuffs"". Holden is deeply upset by this revelation, having previously believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. He angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game, and clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing. During a tearful argument, she tells Holden about her ""many"" youthful sexual experimentations. She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with. However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling disillusioned and furious.
Later, during lunch with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), Silent Bob reveals that he was once in a relationship similar to Holden's. Despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, Amy, his neurosis about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her. Angry at himself for letting her go, he has ""spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak.""
Moved by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his estranged friendship with Banky. He invites them both over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend. He also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him—kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests a threesome. Though initially shocked, Banky agrees to participate, whereas Alyssa explains to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, she states that she loves him, but she will not be his ""whore."" Banky then gets up and enters his bedroom and closes the door without saying a word.
One year later, both Banky and Alyssa are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention in New York. It is revealed that Holden has dissolved their partnership over Bluntman and Chronic, leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to Banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Banky smiles sadly at seeing Holden, who silently congratulates him for his success on his own solo comic. Banky gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, and provides wordless encouragement to Holden to go talk to her. He has a brief, quietly emotional conversation with Alyssa, and gives her a copy of Chasing Amy, his new comic based on their failed relationship. It's revealed that Holden's career in comics ended completely after this. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend (Virginia Smith) arrives and asks who she was talking to. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa replies, ""Oh, just some guy I knew.""",comedy holden mcneil ben affleck banky edward jason lee comic book artist lifelong friend meet fellow comic book artist alyssa jones joey lauren adams comic book convention new york city promote comic bluntman chronic holden attract alyssa soon learn lesbian begin hang deep friendship develop eventually holden long able contain feeling confess love alyssa initially angry night begin romantic relationship new development worsen tension holden banky hate mistrust alyssa disturb holden relationship banky investigate uncover dirt alyssa past report holden alyssa participate threesome guy high school give nickname finger cuff holden deeply upset revelation having previously believe man alyssa sleep angrily confront alyssa attend hockey game clumsily attempt bait confessing tearful argument tell holden youthful sexual experimentation apologize let believe man refuse apologize past holden leave feel disillusioned furious later lunch jay silent bob jason mewe kevin smith silent bob reveal relationship similar holden despite fact love girlfriend amy neurosis adventurous sexual past cause sabotage relationship leave angry let spend day chase amy speak move silent bob story holden devise plan fix relationship alyssa estranged friendship banky invite tell alyssa like past remain boyfriend tell banky realize banky love kiss passionately prove point holden suggest threesome initially shock banky agree participate alyssa explain holden save relationship leave state love whore banky get enter bedroom close door say word year later banky alyssa busy promote respective comic_strip convention new york reveal holden dissolve partnership bluntman chronic leave viewer assumption sell publishing creative right banky corroborate beginning jay silent bob strike banky smile sadly see holden silently congratulate success solo comic banky gesture booth host alyssa provide wordless encouragement holden talk brief quietly emotional conversation alyssa give copy chase amy new comic base fail relationship reveal holden career comic_strip end completely holden leave alyssa new girlfriend virginia smith arrive ask talk shaken misty eyed alyssa reply oh guy know

Mad Max,action / adventure,"""A few years from now"", when society is teetering upon the brink of collapse, berserk motorbike gang member Crawford ""Nightrider"" Montazano steals a Pursuit Special, which he uses to escape from police custody after killing a rookie officer of an Australian highway patrol called the Main Force Patrol (MFP). Even though he manages to elude other MFP officers, the MFP's top pursuit man Max Rockatansky then engages the less-skilled Nightrider in a high-speed chase. Crawford breaks off first, but then is unable to recover his concentration before he and his girlfriend are killed in a fiery crash.
At the MFP garage, Max is shown what one of the MFP mechanics has been working on: a supercharged black Pursuit Special, the last of the V8 Interceptors.
Meanwhile, Nightrider's motorbike gang, led by Toecutter and Bubba Zanetti, run roughshod over a town, vandalising property, stealing fuel, and terrorising the population. They trap a young couple in a car, destroy the car, and it is implied that they rape the couple. Max and fellow officer Jim Goose arrest Toecutter's young protégé Johnny the Boy at the scene. When neither the rape victims nor any of the townspeople show for Johnny's trial, the federal courts close the case, Johnny's attorneys releasing him into Bubba's custody over Goose's furious objections.
While Goose visits a nightclub in the city the next day, Johnny sabotages his police motorbike in the parking lot. After being thrown into a field at high speed uninjured during a ride, Goose borrows a ute to haul his damaged bike back to the MFP. However, Johnny ambushes Goose off the road by throwing a brake drum through his windshield, and, at Toecutter's insistence, throws a match into the wreck of the ute, igniting the gasoline and burning Goose alive. After seeing Goose's charred body in a hospital intensive-care unit, Max becomes disillusioned with the MFP, and informs his superior Fifi Macaffee that he will resign. Fifi convinces Max to take a vacation first before he submits his final letter of resignation.
Max takes his wife Jessie and their infant son Sprog on vacation in a panel van. When they stop to fix the spare tyre, Jessie takes Sprog to buy ice cream. They encounter Toecutter and his gang, who attempt to molest Jessie, but Jessie kicks Toecutter in the crotch, picks up Sprog and escapes with him in the car. They flee to a remote farm owned by an elderly friend named May Swaisey. Toecutter's gang follows them there and ambushes Jessie in the woods. With May's help, Jessie and Sprog escape, but when they try to drive away, the van overheats and they are run over by the gang while trying to escape on foot. Sprog is killed and Jessie is badly injured. Max arrives too late to do anything.
Jessie is near death in a hospital ICU, and the loss of his family ultimately drives Max into a mad rage. He dons his police uniform and takes the black Pursuit Special from the MFP garage to pursue and eliminate the gang. He rams several gang members off a bridge at high speed, kills Bubba during an ambush, and forces Toecutter into the path of a speeding semi-trailer truck. Finally, Max locates Johnny at a car wreck stealing the boots of its dead driver. Max handcuffs Johnny's ankle to the wrecked vehicle, and sets a crude time-delay fuse involving a slow petrol leak and Johnny's lighter. Max throws Johnny a hacksaw, leaving him the choice of sawing through either the handcuffs or his ankle in order to escape within the given time limit. As Max drives away from the bridge, the vehicle explodes. Now a shell of his former self, Max drives on to points unknown.",action adventure year society teeter brink collapse berserk motorbike gang member crawford nightrider montazano steal pursuit special use escape police custody kill rookie officer australian highway patrol call main force patrol mfp manage elude mfp officer mfp pursuit man max rockatansky engage skilled nightrider high speed chase crawford break unable recover concentration girlfriend kill fiery crash mfp garage max show mfp mechanic work supercharge black pursuit special interceptor nightrider motorbike gang lead toecutter bubba zanetti run roughshod town vandalise property steal fuel terrorise population trap young couple car destroy car imply rape couple max fellow officer jim goose arrest toecutter young protégé johnny boy scene rape victim townspeople johnny trial federal court close case johnny attorney release bubba custody goose furious objection goose visit nightclub city day johnny sabotage police motorbike parking lot throw field high speed uninjured ride goose borrow ute haul damage bike mfp johnny ambush goose road throw brake drum windshield toecutter insistence throw match wreck ute ignite gasoline burn goose alive see goose charred body hospital intensive care unit max disillusioned mfp inform superior fifi macaffee resign fifi convinces max vacation submit final letter resignation max take wife jessie infant son sprog vacation panel van stop fix spare tyre jessie take sprog buy ice cream encounter toecutter gang attempt molest jessie jessie kick toecutter crotch pick sprog escape car flee remote farm own elderly friend name swaisey toecutter gang follow ambush jessie wood help jessie sprog escape try drive away van overheat run gang try escape foot sprog kill jessie badly injure max arrive late jessie near death hospital icu loss family ultimately drive max mad rage don police uniform take black pursuit special mfp garage pursue eliminate gang ram gang member bridge high speed kill bubba ambush force toecutter path speeding semi trailer truck finally max locate johnny car wreck steal boot dead driver max handcuffs johnny ankle wreck vehicle set crude time delay fuse involve slow petrol leak johnny light max throw johnny hacksaw leave choice saw handcuff ankle order escape give time limit max drive away bridge vehicle explode shell self max drive point unknown
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar",comedy,"After tying for the win in New York City's ""Drag Queen of the Year"" contest, Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes) and Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) win a trip to Hollywood to take part in the even bigger ""Miss Drag Queen of America Pageant"". Before they depart, Vida persuades Noxeema to take along the inexperienced ""drag princess"" Chi-Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo) as their protégé (they initially refer to him simply as a ""boy in a dress"" rather than as a fully-fledged drag queen). To do this, they trade in their airplane tickets for cash and buy a stylish but old Cadillac convertible with money given to them by John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt (Robin Williams). They set off for Los Angeles in it, carrying with them an iconic autographed photo of Julie Newmar (signed, ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar"") that Vida purloined from a restaurant wall.
While on the road they are pulled over by the racist, homophobic, and sexist Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn), who tries to rape Vida. He discovers Vida is not a woman and, in the commotion, he falls backwards and is knocked unconscious. They think he is dead, hurry off, and leave him behind. As they recover from the incident at a rest stop, their car breaks down. Bobby Ray (Jason London), a young man from the nearby small town of Snydersville, happens to pass by and gives them a ride, where they take refuge in a bed and breakfast inn owned by Carol Ann (Stockard Channing) and her abusive car repairman husband, Virgil (Arliss Howard).
They become stranded in the town for the weekend as they wait for the replacement part for their car to arrive. Chi-Chi is harassed by a group of roughnecks, but is saved by Bobby Ray. While volunteering to help with the town's Strawberry Social, they decide its small band of women need a day with them, which consists of the following steps: get your hair done, pick out a new outfit, and then just sit in a cafe and talk. While searching for the new outfits, they are ecstatic to find vintage fashions from the 1960s in the town's clothing store and give the female residents (and themselves) a make-over.
Following their makeover, they are abused by the same roughnecks that attempted to attack Chi-Chi. Fed up, Noxeema handles the situation in a typically New York City manner and teaches their ringleader a lesson in manners. Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi do what they can to be positive, and they set out to improve the lives of the townspeople, including offering assistance in organizing the Strawberry Social.
Meanwhile, Sheriff Dollard is ridiculed by his colleagues, who believe he was beat up by a girl. He goes off in search of the drag queens.
Vida, in the meantime, becomes acutely aware of Carol Ann's abuse at the hands of Virgil and, shortly thereafter, they overhear him giving her another beating. Vida decides to intervene and beats him up before throwing him out of the house.
Carol Ann is able to repair their car, but they remain for the Strawberry Social. Carol Ann reveals to Vida that she knew she was a drag queen all along due to her Adam's apple, which is less prominent in women.
Not too far away, Virgil runs into Sheriff Dollard at a bar and they realize that the newcomers are the same people Dollard has been searching for. They head back to Snydersville, and Dollard demands that the townspeople turn them over. The other townspeople, who now realize that their new friends are not women, begin to protect them. One by one they step up and confront Dollard, each one claiming to be a drag queen (in similar fashion to Spartacus). He is humiliated and flees. The Strawberry Social commences with everyone dressed in vibrant red outfits for it. The townfolk then say goodbye to their new friends as Noxeema, Vida and Chi-Chi prepare to leave. In honor of their friendship, Vida gives Carol Ann the autographed photo of Julie Newmar that has accompanied them on their trip.
They eventually make it to Los Angeles where Chi-Chi, after having received many tips from Vida and Noxeema during their ordeal, wins the title of Drag Queen of the Year.

The X-Files,science fiction,"The film opens in 35,000 B.C., in what will become North Texas. Two cavemen hunters encounter a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of men wearing hazmat suits arrive and extract the bodies of the boy and the firefighters. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.
Mulder and Scully are later chastised because, in addition to Michaud, four other people were in the building during the bombing. That evening Mulder is accosted by a paranoid doctor, Alvin Kurtzweil, who explains that the ""victims"" were already dead, and that the bombing was staged to cover up how they died. At the hospital morgue, Scully is able to examine one of the victims, finding evidence of an alien virus. Meanwhile, the Cigarette Smoking Man goes to Texas, where Dr. Ben Bronschweig shows him one of the lost firefighters, who has an alien organism residing inside his body. He orders Bronschweig to administer a vaccine to it, but to burn the body if it fails. Later, the alien organism unexpectedly gestates and kills Bronschweig. Mulder and Scully travel to the crime scene in Texas, encountering the boys whose friend fell into the hole. Following their direction, they discover a large cornfield surrounding two glowing domes. Inside the domes, grates in the floor open and swarms of bees fly out. The agents flee, chased by black helicopters, but manage to escape.
After returning to Washington, D.C., Scully attends a performance hearing, after which she is transferred. Mulder is devastated to lose his partner. The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar, and she quickly loses consciousness. Mulder calls paramedics, but the driver of the ambulance shoots Mulder and whisks Scully away. Mulder, not severely injured, slips out of hospital with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner. He then meets a former adversary, the Well-Manicured Man, who gives him Scully's location, along with a vaccine against the virus that has infected her. As Mulder leaves, the Well-Manicured Man kills himself in a car bomb, before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered.
Mulder finds Scully underground in Antarctica, in a large facility containing many humans in ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.
At another crop outpost in Tunisia, the Cigarette Smoking Man warns Strughold that Mulder remains a threat, as he explains what Mulder has found out about the virus. He then hands him a telegram revealing that the X-files unit has been re-opened.",science fiction film open north texas caveman hunter encounter large extraterrestrial life form cave kill infect black oil like substance area boy fall hole infect black substance seep ground firefighter enter hole rescue come team man wear hazmat suit arrive extract body boy firefighter fbi special agent fox mulder dana scully investigate bomb threat federal building dallas discover bomb building street building evacuate special agent charge darius michaud remain ostensibly disarm bomb simply wait bomb detonate mulder scully later chastise addition michaud people building bombing evening mulder accost paranoid doctor alvin kurtzweil explain victim dead bombing stage cover die hospital morgue scully able examine victim find evidence alien virus cigarette smoking man go texas dr ben bronschweig show lose firefighter alien organism reside inside body order bronschweig administer vaccine burn body fail later alien organism unexpectedly gestate kill bronschweig mulder scully travel crime scene texas encounter boy friend fall hole follow direction discover large cornfield surround glowing dome inside dome grate floor open swarm bee fly agent flee chase black helicopter manage escape return washington scully attend performance hearing transfer mulder devastate lose partner share kiss scully sting bee lodge shirt collar quickly lose consciousness mulder call paramedic driver ambulance shoot mulder whisk scully away mulder severely injure slip hospital help lone gunman fbi assistant director walter skinner meet adversary manicure man give scully location vaccine virus infect mulder leave manicure man kill car bomb betrayal syndicate discover mulder find scully underground antarctica large facility contain human ice like enclosure break scully confinement use vaccine revive disrupt facility cocoon alien begin try escape agent escape surface huge alien vessel emerge beneath ice travel sky mulder watch disappear distance scully regain consciousness time later scully attend hearing testimony disregarded evidence cover hand remain proof ordeal bee sting note fbi currently capable investigate evidence outside mulder read article cover dome crop field texas scully inform mulder willing continue work crop outpost tunisia cigarette smoking man warn strughold mulder remain threat explain mulder find virus hand telegram reveal x files unit open
Jhinder Bandi,-,"A person comes to meet with Gauri Shankar Roy (Uttam Kumar) living in Kolkata. He introduces himself as a 'fauji Sardar' of Jhind, Jhind being a small kingdom in Madhya Pradesh. He says that the to-be king of Jhind, Shankar Singh, is found missing from the kingdom right before his coronation and this is apparently a conspiracy by his own brother Udit Singh, who wants the kingdom for himself. Earlier too there were two occasions when abhishek was arranged but both the times the king was found missing. Udit is a cruel hearted man, unfit to be a good king. Shankar Singh has his vices too but is a kind hearted person who would care for his citizens and is thus worthy to be the king. Now, coincidentally, Gauri has exactly the same appearance as Shankar Singh(also played by Uttam Kumar). This being the last hope, Sardar requests him to enact the role of the King for the abhishek until he finds the real king. Gauri agrees.The two set off for Jhind.
Things aren't easy at the Palace in Jhind. Despite the great luxury of kingly life, Gauri is constantly threatened by Udit and his friend, the dashingly handsome but evil Mayurvahan (Soumitra Chatterjee). The abhishek however takes place successfully in the occasion of which the king is also engaged to Rani Kasturi Bai (Arundhati Devi). While the atmosphere gets more and more tensed, the life of king is at stake, there is also a blooming romance between Kasturi Bai and Gauri.
A secret agent unfolds that the king is hidden in the fortress owned by Udit who will murder him as soon as he gets rid of Gauri. Sardar then reveals to Gauri in secret that Gauri deserves the throne as much as Shankar or Udit because they were all the sons of the then-Dewan of Jhind,Kali Shankar Roy.

Charlie Wilson's War,"biography, drama","In 1980, Congressman Charlie Wilson is more interested in partying than legislating, frequently throwing huge galas and staffing his congressional office with young, attractive women. His social life eventually brings about a federal investigation into allegations of his cocaine use, conducted by federal prosecutor Rudy Giuliani as part of a larger investigation into congressional misconduct. The investigation results in no charge against Charlie.
A friend and romantic interest, Joanne Herring, encourages Charlie to do more to help the Afghan people, and persuades Charlie to visit the Pakistani leadership. The Pakistanis complain about the inadequate support of the U.S. to oppose the Soviet Union, and they insist that Charlie visit a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp. Charlie is deeply moved by their misery and determination to fight, but is frustrated by the regional CIA personnel's insistence on a low key approach against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Charlie returns home to lead an effort to substantially increase funding to the mujahideen.
As part of this effort, Charlie befriends maverick CIA operative Gust Avrakotos and his understaffed Afghanistan group to find a better strategy, especially including a means to counter the Soviets' formidable Mi-24 helicopter gunship. This group was composed in part of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division, including a young paramilitary officer named Michael Vickers. As a result, Charlie's deft political bargaining for the necessary funding and Avrakotos' careful planning using those resources, such as supplying the guerrillas with FIM-92 Stinger missile launchers, turns the Soviet occupation into a deadly quagmire with their heavy fighting vehicles being destroyed at a crippling rate. Charlie enlists the support of Israel and Egypt for Soviet weapons and consumables, and Pakistan for distribution of arms. The CIA's anti-communism budget evolves from $5 million to over $500 million (with the same amount matched by Saudi Arabia), startling several congressmen. This effort by Charlie ultimately evolves into a major portion of the U.S. foreign policy known as the Reagan Doctrine, under which the U.S. expanded assistance beyond just the mujahideen and began also supporting other anti-communist resistance movements around the world. Charlie states that senior Pentagon official Michael Pillsbury persuaded President Ronald Reagan to provide the Stingers to the Afghans.
Charlie follows Gust's guidance to seek support for post-Soviet occupation Afghanistan, but finds no enthusiasm in the government for even the modest measures he proposes. In the end, Charlie receives a major commendation for his support of the U.S. clandestine services, but his pride is tempered by his fears of the blowback his secret efforts could yield in the future and the implications of U.S. disengagement from Afghanistan.",biography drama congressman charlie wilson interested party legislate frequently throw huge gala staff congressional office young attractive woman social life eventually bring federal investigation allegation cocaine use conduct federal prosecutor rudy giuliani large investigation congressional misconduct investigation result charge charlie friend romantic interest joanne herring encourage charlie help afghan people persuade charlie visit pakistani leadership pakistani complain inadequate support oppose soviet union insist charlie visit major pakistan base afghan refugee camp charlie deeply move misery determination fight frustrate regional cia personnel insistence low key approach soviet occupation afghanistan charlie return home lead effort substantially increase funding mujahideen effort charlie befriend maverick cia operative gust avrakoto understaffed afghanistan group find well strategy especially include means counter soviet formidable helicopter gunship group compose member cia special activity division include young paramilitary officer name michael vicker result charlie deft political bargaining necessary funding avrakoto careful planning resource supply guerrilla stinger missile launcher turn soviet occupation deadly quagmire heavy fighting vehicle destroy crippling rate charlie enlist support israel egypt soviet weapon consumable pakistan distribution arm cia anti communism budget evolve million million match saudi arabia startle congressman effort charlie ultimately evolve major portion foreign policy know reagan doctrine expand assistance mujahideen began support anti communist resistance movement world charlie state senior pentagon official michael pillsbury persuade president ronald reagan provide stinger afghans charlie follow gust guidance seek support post soviet occupation afghanistan find enthusiasm government modest measure propose end charlie receive major commendation support clandestine service pride temper fear blowback secret effort yield future implication disengagement afghanistan
Reach for the Sky,biopic/world war ii,"In 1928, Douglas Bader joins the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a cadet. Despite a friendly reprimand from Air Vice-Marshal Halahan for his disregard for service discipline and flight rules, he successfully completes his training and is posted to No. 23 Squadron at RAF Kenley. In 1930, he is chosen to be among the pilots for an aerial exhibition.
Later, although his flight commander has explicitly banned low level aerobatics (as two pilots have been killed trying just that), he is goaded into it by a disparaging remark by a civilian pilot. He crashes.
Mr Joyce, surgeon at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, has to amputate both legs to save Bader's life. During his convalescence, he receives encouragement from Nurse Brace. Upon his discharge from the hospital, he sets out to master prosthetic legs. At a stop for some tea, he meets waitress Thelma Edwards. Once he can walk on his own, he starts courting her.
Despite his undiminished skills, he is refused flying duties simply because there are no regulations covering his situation. Offered a desk job instead, he leaves the RAF and works unhappily in an office. He and Thelma marry.
As the Second World War starts, Bader talks himself back into the RAF. He is soon given command of a squadron comprising mostly dispirited Canadians who had fought in France. Improving morale and brazenly circumventing normal channels to obtain badly needed equipment, he makes the squadron operational again. They fight effectively in the Battle of Britain. Bader is then put in charge of a new, larger formation of five squadrons. Later, he is posted to RAF Tangmere and promoted to wing commander.
In 1941, Bader has to bail out over France. He is caught, escapes, and is recaptured. He then makes such a nuisance of himself to his jailers, he is repeatedly moved from one POW camp to another, finally ending up in Colditz Castle. He is liberated after four years of captivity. The war ends (much to Thelma's relief) before Bader can have ""one last fling"" in the Far East.
On 15 September 1945, the fifth anniversary of the greatest day of the Battle of Britain, Bader, now a group captain, is given the honour of leading eleven other battle survivors and a total of 300 aircraft in a flypast over London.",biopic world war ii douglas bader join royal air force raf cadet despite friendly reprimand air vice marshal halahan disregard service discipline flight rule successfully complete training post squadron raf kenley choose pilot aerial exhibition later flight commander explicitly ban low level aerobatic pilot kill try goad disparaging remark civilian pilot crash mr joyce surgeon royal berkshire hospital amputate leg save bader life convalescence receive encouragement nurse brace discharge hospital set master prosthetic leg stop tea meet waitress thelma edward walk start court despite undiminished skill refuse fly duty simply regulation cover situation offer desk job instead leave raf work unhappily office thelma marry second world war start bader talk raf soon give command squadron comprising dispirit canadian fight france improve morale brazenly circumvent normal channel obtain badly need equipment make squadron operational fight effectively battle britain bader charge new large formation squadron later post raf tangmere promote wing commander bader bail france catch escape recapture make nuisance jailer repeatedly move pow camp finally end colditz castle liberate year captivity war end thelma relief bader fling far east september fifth anniversary great day battle britain bader group captain give honour lead battle survivor total aircraft flypast london

 I Spy,action,"At the Bureau of National Security headquarters, Special Agent Alex Scott is accosted by his rival, Carlos, before being briefed on his next mission. Scott is assigned to recover a stolen fighter, the ""Switchblade,"" plane sold to arms dealer Arnold Gundars. Gundars is sponsoring Middleweight world boxing champion Kelly Robinson's next match and using the event to auction the plane. The agency has contacted Robinson and assigned him to be the civilian cover for Scott's mission. Scott and Robinson travel to Budapest, where Scott plans to penetrate Gundars' compound during a pre-fight party.
Arriving in Budapest, Robinson is kidnapped. During the interrogation Scott bursts in, frees Robinson, and fights the kidnappers before revealing this was a test which Kelly passed by not divulging Scott's identity. At Gundars's party, Robinson replaces Gundars's pen with a duplicate fitted with a tracking device before confronting his European challenger in the party's boxing ring. Scott, posing as a member of Robinson's entourage, uses this as a diversion to enter Gundars' private office and hack his computer. Robinson arrives unexpectedly and trips an alarm. The two are forced to escape and manage to evade their pursuers by hiding in a sewer.
After returning to base, Robinson coaches Scott into winning Agent Rachel Wright by feeding him lines from the song ""Sexual Healing"" by Marvin Gaye. Scott succeeds, but is interrupted by movement on the pen tracking device. He tracks Gundars to a bathhouse, which Scott believes is a dead end. Robinson has a hunch that the plane is hidden in the building, leading the two into a fight with Gundars's men. Gundars speeds off in his car, with Wright in pursuit. Wright's car explodes and Scott blames Robinson for her death. The two engage in a public confrontation that leads to Robinson's arrest. Scott convinces the BNS that the operation can continue and tracks Gundars down again.
Robinson reaches the arena just in time for his fight. Scott finds Gundars with terrorists, who are busy fitting the plane with a nuclear missile. Scott takes the men by surprise and forces them to surrender, before being disarmed by Agent Wright, who reveals she is a double agent. Wright tortures Scott for the Switchblade's activation codes. Scott activates the contact lens gadget, allowing Robinson to see the dilemma as he battles his opponent in the ring. Robinson gets knocked down for the first time in his career, but recovers, defeats his opponent, and departs for the bridge. Robinson sets off a firefight which kills many of the terrorists. After Carlos lands in a parachute, Robinson infers that Carlos is also corrupt. When Carlos provokes Kelly, he knocks him out, scattering the terrorists for them to take cover. Robinson takes out the remaining terrorists, while their leader, Zhu Tam, and Gundars are both killed by Wright. After the bomb on the plane is destroyed, Robinson tells Rachel to put the gun down. Wright makes up a lie that the BNS suspected that Carlos was corrupt and says that they pretended to team up with Carlos so they can catch him and uses this to convince the others that she is innocent. The confusion leads to a fight between Scott and Carlos, allowing Wright to escape with Gundars' briefcase. Scott and Robinson attempt to fly the Switchblade away, but it crashes into the river. While in the water, Robinson discovers the nuclear weapon. Scott realizes the mission is a success after all, and Robinson remarks that he will be recognized as a hero.
Later in Monte Carlo, Scott and Robinson track down Agent Wright and place her under arrest. Scott turns up a copy of USA Today and sees a picture of Carlos in a parade with President Bush. Robinson takes this news hard, and refuses to accompany Scott to BNS headquarters for a mission debrief. Scott tells Robinson the agency has perfected a jelly-like substance that will allow its wearer to float through the air. Robinson happily agrees to go, and Scott tells another agent to retrieve some jars of jelly and two parachutes.",action bureau national security headquarter special agent alex scott accost rival carlos brief mission scott assign recover steal fighter switchblade plane sell arm dealer arnold gundar gundars sponsor middleweight world boxing champion kelly robinson match event auction plane agency contact robinson assign civilian cover scott mission scott robinson travel budapest scott plan penetrate gundar compound pre fight party arrive budapest robinson kidnap interrogation scott burst free robinson fight kidnapper reveal test kelly pass divulge scott identity gundars party robinson replace gundar pen duplicate fit tracking device confront european challenger party boxing ring scott pose member robinson entourage use diversion enter gundar private office hack computer robinson arrive unexpectedly trip alarm force escape manage evade pursuer hide sewer return base robinson coach scott win agent rachel wright feed line song sexual healing marvin gaye scott succeed interrupt movement pen tracking device track gundar bathhouse scott believe dead end robinson hunch plane hide building lead fight gundar man gundar speed car wright pursuit wright car explode scott blame robinson death engage public confrontation lead robinson arrest scott convince bns operation continue track gundar robinson reach arena time fight scott find gundar terrorist busy fit plane nuclear missile scott take man surprise force surrender disarm agent wright reveal double agent wright torture scott switchblade activation code scott activate contact lens gadget allow robinson dilemma battle opponent ring robinson get knock time career recover defeat opponent depart bridge robinson set firefight kill terrorist carlos lands parachute robinson infer carlos corrupt carlos provokes kelly knock scatter terrorist cover robinson take remain terrorist leader zhu tam gundar kill wright bomb plane destroy robinson tell rachel gun wright make lie bns suspect carlos corrupt say pretend team carlos catch use convince innocent confusion lead fight scott carlos allow wright escape gundar briefcase scott robinson attempt fly switchblade away crash river water robinson discover nuclear weapon scott realize mission success robinson remark recognize hero later monte carlo scott robinson track agent wright place arrest scott turn copy usa today see picture carlo parade president bush robinson take news hard refuse accompany scott bns headquarters mission debrief scott tell robinson agency perfect jelly like substance allow wearer float air robinson happily agree scott tell agent retrieve jar jelly parachute

Battleship,"action, science fiction","In 2005, the Gliese system is discovered to have a potentially habitable planet and a communications array is built by NASA to sent a transmission from Hawaii. Meanwhile, Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress Sam Shane. His brother, naval officer Stone, forces Alex to join the U.S. Navy in order to improve his life.
In 2012, Alex and Sam are in a relationship and Alex serves as a lieutenant aboard the USS John Paul Jones while Stone commands the USS Sampson, but Alex is in danger of receiving a disciplinary discharge. During the 2012 RIMPAC exercise, five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship collides with a satellite and crashes in Hong Kong while the other four land in the waters off Hawaii. Sampson, John Paul Jones, and the JMSDF Myōkō investigate and discover a floating structure. When it is touched by Alex it generates a force field that encloses the Hawaiian Islands and separates the ships from the fleet. Three alien warships surface and begin a confrontation. In the ensuing engagement both the Sampson and the Myōkō are destroyed, resulting in Stone's death, while the command crew of the John Paul Jones are killed. Alex assumes command as the ranking officer. They recover the survivors from Myōkō, including Captain Nagata. The alien structure launches drones towards Hawaii, which attack and cause heavy damage.
On Oahu, Sam, a physical therapist, is accompanying retired U.S. Army Colonel and double amputee Mick Canales on a mountain hike. After becoming aware of the aliens' presence, they encounter scientist Cal Zapata who informs them the aliens have taken over the communications array, and Mick determines that they are planning to use it to re-establish communications with their home planet. Aboard the John Paul Jones, naval personnel capture a semiconscious alien. The alien forms a telepathic link with Alex, showing him they have successfully invaded and conquered other planets. Other aliens arrive to retrieve their comrade, but are prevented from sabotaging the ship. Examination of the captured alien's helmet reveals the aliens are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam and Mick force Zapata to recover his spectrum analyzer from the aliens. They use it to radio the John Paul Jones and inform them the aliens will be able to contact their planet in four hours.
With radar disabled, Captain Nagata suggests using NOAA's tsunami warning buoys around Hawaii to track the alien warships. This allows the John Paul Jones to destroy two of them but the third evades their fire. At dawn, they lure the warship eastwards as Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows, blinding its crew and allowing the John Paul Jones to destroy the alien ship. The John Paul Jones is then sunk by alien drones as the crew escape.
The survivors return to Pearl Harbor and commandeer the USS Missouri, a decommissioned battleship. With the aid of the retired veterans preserving her, the Missouri is restored to battle readiness and confronts the alien structure, revealed to be a giant mothership. In the ensuing battle, the Missouri severely damages its quarry and disables the force field. Meanwhile, Sam, Mick and Cal attempt to stall the aliens at the communications array. As the mothership rallies, Alex uses their last shell to destroy the communications array. Fighters from the RIMPAC fleet suddenly arrive and destroy the drones and the mothership, eliminating the alien threat.
A ceremony is held to honor the military personnel, where Alex is promoted to lieutenant commander and presented with both a Silver Star and his brother's posthumous Navy Cross. After the ceremony, Alex asks Sam's father Admiral Terrance Shane for her hand in marriage. The admiral initially refuses, but then invites Alex to lunch to discuss the matter, referencing how Alex and Sam met.

Demon Knight,horror,"A woman, having recently murdered a man, soaks in the bath. The corpse of the murdered man then awakens and attempts to murder the woman. Right before the corpse hacks the woman to death, the whole thing turns out to be a film shoot with the Crypt Keeper directing. While the angry Crypt Keeper berates the lead actor (John Larroquette) for his lack of talent, he becomes aware of the viewer and begins to promote his latest project, which he hopes will get him into Hollywood: Demon Knight.
On a desert road in New Mexico, The Collector (Billy Zane) pursues drifter Frank Brayker (William Sadler). The vehicles crash and Brayker flees. Local drunk Uncle Willy (Dick Miller) takes him to a decommissioned church converted into a boarding house, where he rents a room and observes the residents: owner Irene (C. C. H. Pounder), prostitute Cordelia (Brenda Bakke), postal clerk Wally (Charles Fleischer), and a convict on work release named Jeryline (Jada Pinkett Smith). A misogynistic cook named Roach (Thomas Haden Church) arrives and informs the group about a theft attempt on his employer's car, unaware it was Brayker, and a suspicious Irene calls the sheriff. Sheriff Tupper (John Schuck) and his deputy Bob (Gary Farmer) encounter The Collector at the crash site, who convinces them that Brayker is a dangerous thief. At the boarding house, Tupper and Bob learn that Brayker is in possession of an important artifact and that he is carrying false ID. Tupper also gets word from his base that both cars were stolen and he arrests Brayker as well as The Collector. The Collector kills Tupper by punching through his skull. Driven outside by the key-like artifact Brayker possesses, The Collector draws his own blood on the sand and produces a team of demonic creatures.
Brayker uses blood from the artifact to protect the building and tells the group they must wait out the night. Unable to get in, The Collector uses psychic powers to seduce and possess Cordelia. Cordelia kills Wally and cripples Irene before Brayker kills her. The group attempts to escape through old mine tunnels under the building, where Jeryline finds Danny hiding. The other townsfolk, under demonic possession, drive them back into the church. The residents demand an explanation, and Brayker reluctantly tells them the history of the key artifact. Following the creation of Earth by God, demons used seven keys to focus the power of the cosmos into their hands. When discovered, God created light, which scattered the demons and the keys across the universe. The artifact that Brayker holds is the last key needed to reclaim power; and to protect it, God had a thief named Sirach fill it with the blood of Jesus Christ. The guardians of the key, immortal while holding it, have since passed it on, refilling it with their own blood when they die. Brayker received the key from his commanding officer during World War I. Danny disappears and Jeryline rallies everyone to look for him, during which Roach sneaks the key out of Brayker's satchel.
In the church attic, Irene and Bob discover that Wally was planning to attack the post office with a trunk full of weapons. The Collector soon possesses Uncle Willy, who attacks the others. While battling Willy, Roach makes a deal with The Collector to trade his life for the key, but The Collector betrays and kills him soon after Roach walks away. Brayker retrieves the key in the battle and Irene and Bob sacrifice themselves to stop the remaining minions. In the attic, The Collector brainwashes Danny, who mortally wounds Brayker before Jeryline kills him. As he dies, Brayker initiates Jeryline as a guardian of the key, deactivating all blood seals. Jeryline confronts The Collector and spits blood from the key in his face, causing him to transform into a large demon before being destroyed.
At dawn, Jeryline refills the key with Brayker's blood and boards a bus with her cat, sealing the door behind them. Down the road, the bus stops to pick up a stranger (Mark David Kennerly), who declines to get on stating that he'll catch the next one. Dressed identically to his predecessor and carrying the same suitcase, Jeryline realizes that he is the next Collector. After exchanging a glance in passing, the new Collector begins following on foot, whistling the theme song to the Tales from the Crypt television series.
While the Collector walks away, the camera shifts to a nearby hole, which leads to the Crypt Keeper's home. He prepares for the premiere of his film with the starlets with him. The Crypt Keeper informs the viewer that Jeryline lives happily ever after and is enjoying traveling the world. Once he arrives at the lavish premiere, the producers reveal their powers of ""final cut"", snare him in a guillotine, and decapitate him, much to his delight.",horror woman having recently murder man soak bath corpse murder man awaken attempt murder woman right corpse hack woman death thing turn film shoot crypt keeper directing angry crypt keeper berate lead actor john larroquette lack talent aware viewer begin promote late project hope hollywood demon knight desert road new mexico collector billy zane pursue drifter frank brayker william sadler vehicle crash brayker flee local drunk uncle willy dick miller take decommission church convert boarding house rent room observe resident owner irene pounder prostitute cordelia brenda bakke postal clerk wally charles fleischer convict work release name jeryline jada pinkett smith misogynistic cook name roach thomas haden church arrive inform group theft attempt employer car unaware brayker suspicious irene call sheriff sheriff tupper john schuck deputy bob gary farmer encounter collector crash site convince brayker dangerous thief boarding house tupper bob learn brayker possession important artifact carry false tupper get word base car steal arrest brayker collector collector kill tupper punch skull drive outside key like artifact brayker possesse collector draw blood sand produce team demonic creature brayker use blood artifact protect building tell group wait night unable collector use psychic power seduce possess cordelia cordelia kill wally cripple irene brayker kill group attempt escape old tunnel building jeryline find danny hiding townsfolk demonic possession drive church resident demand explanation brayker reluctantly tell history key artifact follow creation earth god demon seven key focus power cosmo hand discover god create light scatter demon key universe artifact brayker hold key need reclaim power protect god thief name sirach fill blood jesus christ guardian key immortal hold pass refill blood die brayker receive key command officer world war danny disappear jeryline rally look roach sneak key brayker satchel church attic irene bob discover wally plan attack post office trunk weapon collector soon possess uncle willy attack battle willy roach make deal collector trade life key collector betray kill soon roach walk away brayker retrieve key battle irene bob sacrifice stop remain minion attic collector brainwash danny mortally wound brayker jeryline kill die brayker initiate jeryline guardian key deactivate blood seal jeryline confront collector spit blood key face cause transform large demon destroy dawn jeryline refill key brayker blood board bus cat seal door road bus stop pick stranger mark david kennerly decline state catch dress identically predecessor carry suitcase jeryline realize collector exchange glance pass new collector begin follow foot whistle theme song tale crypt television series collector walk away camera shift nearby hole lead crypt keeper home prepare premiere film starlet crypt keeper inform viewer jeryline live happily enjoy travel world arrive lavish premiere producer reveal power final cut snare guillotine decapitate delight
Attack of the Crab Monsters,science fiction,"A group of scientists and their support crew of five sailors land on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. They are searching for a previous expedition that disappeared without a trace, and to continue their research on the effects of radiation from the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests on the island's plant and sea life. The scientists on the expedition are led by Dr. Karl Weigand (Leslie Bradley), and also include geologist James Carson (Richard H. Cutting) and biologists Jules Deveroux (Mel Welles), Martha Hunter (Duncan) and Dale Drewer (Garland). Their party also includes technician and handyman Hank Chapman (Johnson).
Soon after their arrival, a sailor, Tate (Charles B. Griffith), falls in the water and is killed, his decapitated body floating to the surface. Two sailors (Beach Dickerson and Tony Miller) are left behind to guard the explorers, while the others, led by Ensign Quinlan (Ed Nelson), attempt to return to the mainland, but their seaplane explodes.
The scientists are unable to report what happened due to a storm; they decide to stay on the island and continue their research. They read journal entries written by the previous scientific team, which mention killer worm creatures. Martha and Dale go scuba diving. That night, Martha hears ""McLane"", leader of the previous expedition, calling out to her. Carson descends into a pit, which opens outside during an inexplicable earthquake, but falls in.
The current expedition learns to their horror that the earlier group had been killed and eaten by two mutated, intelligent giant crabs, who have absorbed the minds of their victims and can speak telepathically in their voices. Members of the current expedition are being systematically attacked and killed by the monsters, which are now invulnerable to most standard weaponry because of the mutations to their cell structures.
The remaining scientists finally discover that both giant crabs are the cause of the ongoing earthquakes and landslides on the island; they are slowly destroying the island, reducing its size, by undermining it with tunnels. The scientists turn their attention to a way to stop the mating pair of monsters from reproducing. They are able to kill one of the crabs in a cave when their explosive detonates, shaking loose an overhead rock that falls and crushes the head of the monster.
As the island continues to fall away into the Pacific, and after barely escaping from their collapsing laboratory building, the surviving trio of Dale, Martha and Hank finally meet the remaining intelligent giant crab, Hoolar, who speaks to them via telepathy. Hoolar vows to go to the mainland with her fertilized eggs when the island is gone (and the three humans are dead) to feed upon on even more people, absorbing those minds in the process. Hank then sacrifices himself by bringing down an electrically-charged broadcast tower directly on top of the giant crab, electrocuting the monster and her unhatched brood.

However, when his friend Bunny Manders (Bramwell Fletcher) tries to commit suicide because of a gambling debt he cannot repay, Raffles decides to take on one more job for Bunny's sake. He joins Bunny and Gwen as guests of Lord and Lady Melrose, with an eye toward acquiring the Melrose necklace, once the property of Empress Joséphine.
Complications arise when a gang of thieves also decides to try for the necklace at the same time. Inspector Mackenzie of Scotland Yard (David Torrence) gets wind of their plot and shows up at the Melrose estate with his men. Burglar Crawshaw breaks into the house and succeeds in stealing the jewelry, only to have Raffles take it away from him. Crawshaw is caught by the police, but learns his robber's identity.
Meanwhile, both Gwen and Mackenzie suspect that Raffles is the famous jewel thief. When the necklace is not found, Mackenzie insists that all the guests remain inside, then quickly changes his mind. Gwen overhears Mackenzie tell one of his men that he intends to let Crawshaw escape, expecting the crook to go after Raffles and thereby incriminate him. She follows Raffles back to London to warn him.

Then, Raffles publicly confesses to being the Amateur Cracksman.

They run into Alan Jeffcote (Stuart), the son of the owner of the mill in which they work, who has also traveled to Blackpool with a group of friends while his fiancée is detained on business in London. Jenny and Alan hit it off immediately, and he persuades her to leave Blackpool to spend the week with him at Llandudno in North Wales. To cover her tracks, Jenny leaves a postcard with Mary, asking her to send it to her parents (Edmund Gwenn and Sybil Thorndike) later in the week. She and Alan leave their friends and set off for Wales.
Shortly afterwards, Mary is involved in a serious road accident and is killed. Her possessions are returned to Hindle and the unmailed postcard is found in her luggage. Jenny's parents are already suspicious and concerned by the fact that Jenny has not returned to Hindle as they would have expected in view of such a tragic turn to her holiday, and the discovery of the postcard increases their fears. Jenny returns at the end of the week. Her parents ask about her holiday, and allow her to dig a hole for herself as her fictitious account shows she is unaware of Mary's death and has clearly not spent the week in Blackpool. When confronted with the truth, Jenny admits to where she has been, and with whom, and defiantly refuses to be made to feel guilty or immoral.
The Hawthornes decide that they will have to confront the Jeffcotes (McKinnel and Mary Clare) with their son's unacceptable behaviour. Mrs. Hawthorne's anger is tempered by the fact that she believes the situation may be turned to financial advantage. Hawthorne feels some trepidation, as he and Jeffcote have been friends since childhood and have remained on good terms despite Jeffcote's rise to social prominence. To the surprise of the Hawthornes, Jeffcote agrees that in the circumstances Alan must be made to marry Jenny to prevent a scandal. Mrs. Jeffcote is less convinced, anticipating the ruin of Alan's reputation and business prospects. A meeting is convened between all the interested parties.

Jenny and Alan leave to talk alone. She tells him that she has no designs on his money and has no interest in marrying him. She then announces her decision to the incredulous parents, adding that Alan was no more to blame than she was, for both of them it was just a ""little fling"" about which neither need feel guilty, and that a woman has just as much right as a man to enjoy a brief sexual flirtation with no strings attached.

Bead Game,nfb animated short,"A single bead multiplies into two beads. From there, they continue to expand, turning into Atoms which eventually transform into creatures. These creatures magically ingest each other then mutate into other mythical beings. For example, a monster eats a dinosaur then transforms into a seal. This sequence displays how creatures deal with conflict without the control of brain power.
As the cycle continues, the beads eventually turn into humans. The chronological arrangement demonstrates how civilization has dealt with conflict inspired by creatures of the past, only now, with the advancement of technology in terms of the weapons used. For example, in its earliest sequence, it shows humans blasting cannons into enemy territory. It then moves on to humans shooting rifles during war.
The entirety of the short film is based on how different time periods dealt with competition, this this case, it is displayed through malicious actions shown through the evolution of the beads.
To accentuate the seemingly unbroken chain of evolution over centuries, Patel chose to film the beads themselves growing in a constant flow of movement into larger and more complex creatures and images, with the camera continuously zooming out to accommodate the escalation; this requires him to film on a continual basis without deviating from whatever path he had taken once filming began, and cuts had to be kept to an absolute minimum.[6]",nfb animate short single bead multiplie bead continue expand turn atom eventually transform creature creature magically ingest mutate mythical being example monster eat dinosaur transform seal sequence display creature deal conflict control brain power cycle continue bead eventually turn human chronological arrangement demonstrate civilization deal conflict inspire creature past advancement technology term weapon example early sequence show human blast cannon enemy territory move human shoot rifle war entirety short film base different time period deal competition case display malicious action show evolution bead accentuate seemingly unbroken chain evolution century patel choose film bead grow constant flow movement large complex creature image camera continuously zoom accommodate escalation require film continual basis deviate path take filming begin cut keep absolute
Carry On Henry,comedy,"The film opens with a passage, which states:
This film is based on a recently discovered manuscript by one William Cobbler, which reveals that Henry VIII did in fact have two more wives. Although it was first thought that Cromwell originated the story, it is now known to be definitely all Cobbler's... from beginning to end.
Henry VIII (Sid James) has his wife (Patsy Rowlands) beheaded and quickly marries Marie of Normandy (Joan Sims). This union was organised at the behest of bumbling Cardinal Wolsey (Terry Scott) as Marie is cousin of King Francis I of France. Henry's wedding night ardour dies when he finds she reeks of garlic, but she refuses to stop eating it. Marie gets frustrated so soon receives amorous advances from Sir Roger de Lodgerley (Charles Hawtrey who, while still in his camp persona, is playing against type as a ladies man).
Henry is keen to be rid of Marie, as he has met the lovely Bettina (Barbara Windsor, in her favourite Carry On role). Bettina is the daughter of the Earl of Bristol (Peter Butterworth, in a one scene cameo), a punning reference to Bristols. Thomas Cromwell (Kenneth Williams) assists in ousting Marie by organising Lord Hampton of Wick (Kenneth Connor) to kidnap the King in a staged plot. Cromwell and Lord Hampton also secretly plot to bring the king to harm as part of this escapade, but the false kidnapping fails.
Henry seizes on Marie's infidelity with de Lodgerley to be free of her; all he needs is a confession from de Lodgerley. He orders Cromwell to extract a confession using any means necessary. This leads to a running joke in the torture chamber as Henry keeps changing his mind about the confession due to political necessities, requiring multiple changes and retractions of the original confession. Wolsey is baffled by all the intrigue, and Cromwell is driven to treason by all of Henry's unreasonable demands.",comedy film open passage state film base recently discover manuscript william cobbler reveal henry viii fact wife think cromwell originate story know definitely cobbler begin end henry viii sid james wife patsy rowland behead quickly marry marie normandy joan sim union organise behest bumble cardinal wolsey terry scott marie cousin king francis france henry wedding night ardour die find reek garlic refuse stop eat marie get frustrate soon receive amorous advance sir roger de lodgerley charles hawtrey camp persona play type lady man henry keen rid marie meet lovely bettina barbara windsor favourite carry role bettina daughter earl bristol peter butterworth scene cameo pun reference bristol thomas cromwell kenneth williams assist oust marie organise lord hampton wick kenneth connor kidnap king stage plot cromwell lord hampton secretly plot bring king harm escapade false kidnapping fail henry seize marie infidelity de lodgerley free need confession de lodgerley order cromwell extract confession mean necessary lead run joke torture chamber henry keep change mind confession political necessity require multiple change retraction original confession wolsey baffle intrigue cromwell drive treason henry unreasonable demand

Later that night Jones rigs a device to continually dial the same number over and over again to 1-900-976-ROCK to enter a contest and nominate their band The Eradicators as local heroes, in order to win tickets to go see a concert performed by The Pursuit of Happiness, before they perform a show at Reagan High to both make some money, and get their band better known, before thrashing the show after being insulted by the debutante Whitney and her friend Margaret.
Apprehended by Vadar's hall monitors at the conclusion of the dance, they are chastised by Vadar and their classes are changed to no longer coincide with one another's schedules. Further, their lunch schedules are changed as well, making it impossible for them to practice any longer. In their new lunch period, they encounter a shut-in named Tabatha, the supposed daughter of a witch, who believes that the four basic food groups are Sugar, Salt, Fat, and Booze. This doesn't curb their behavior, however, and they continue with their trouble making in a business as usual fashion, mentally traumatizing Mrs. Grossman in the process (something that enrages Vadar), which leads to Vadar implementing a new operation known as 'Reagan High Super Secret Security Program'.
Mag makes friends with Tabatha at this point, after a misunderstanding and they begin to hang out together. However, in the new RHSSSP program, the school is made into (as Vadar describes it) a school-wide detention hall. Their efforts to get the Pursuit of Happiness tickets are made useless, as Vadar and her monitors assault Screaming Steve and the Rock TV crew. Then, as punishment (for nothing at all it would seem) they are given four days of detention. At this point, Jesse is infuriated by the sentence, and vows revenge on Vadar, spurring The Eradicators to begin fighting back to protest, and they vow to play at the prom.
Enlisting the help of Eaglebauer, a business man who seems to work out of one of the bathrooms in the school to disrupt the school in any way possible, such as selling test answers and other services that clearly violate school policy. He rigs the auditions for the school prom, and they enact his plan, winning the audition in the absence of Vadar. Thinking they're on drugs, Vadar institutes drug tests which provides no solution to dealing with the Eradicators. However, they are set up by Vadar, Whitney and Marget and made unable to participate through vandalism of school property (and planting Evidence in the lockers of the four).
Vowing to get even, they go to even greater lengths than before to get vengeance, and use video cameras this time around, taping numerous embarrassing situations, such as Bob and Margaret cheating on Whitney and Donovan, Whitney projectile vomiting on a teacher, Donovan posing with women's underwear, and Vadar having an intimate moment with a submissive slave in her office. They also trick the band Zillion Kisses, getting them to set up and wait in the school's storage room during the prom. The Eradicators make their appearance at the prom, meanwhile. Upon the appearance of the Yupettes, the Eradicators begin playing the video tapes that they've managed to record over the previous week.
Severely embarrassing (and causing infighting among the Yupettes) the Yupettes and Vadar, the situation causes Vadar to go on a homicidal rampage. Driving her car through the school grounds, she has no regard for the safety of anyone on the school grounds. During the aftermath, she tries to kill The Eradicators, as well as Eaglebauer, and even substitute teacher Rita. Not so easily defeated, however, the Eradicators continue to fight back even against the vehicular attempt at manslaughter, and slick a section of the school with chemical extinguishers, which cause Vadar to crash into the school, causing it to explode, and the school catches fire for the second time in 12 years.
During the final sequence, when everyone is witnessing the destruction of the school something emerges from the fire, which quickly turns out to be a flaming tire (which no one attempts to stop, and continues rolling even after the credits finish rolling).

Frankenstein Unbound,horror,"In 2031, Dr. Buchanan and his team work to develop the ultimate weapon, an energy beam that will completely remove whatever it is aimed at. Buchanan hopes he can create a weapon so powerful that it will end all war and have the added benefit of no impact on the environment. Unfortunately, the prototype has unpredictable side effects, creating erratic global weather patterns and rifts in space and time that have caused some people to vanish. As he drives home from the testing facility, Buchanan himself is caught in one such rift.
Buchanan and his futuristic computer-controlled car reappear in Switzerland in 1817. In a village, he meets Victor Frankenstein. The men discuss science over dinner and it is revealed that Frankenstein's young brother has been killed. A trial is to determine the guilt or innocence of the boy's nanny, who is suspected in the murder.
Several villagers claim to have seen a monster in the woods and suggest this is the killer. Buchanan observes the trial and becomes interested in a young woman taking notes. She turns out to be Mary Shelley, author of the Frankenstein novel. Shelley gives credence to the talk of monsters, but the judge does not. The nanny is found guilty and sentenced to die at the gallows. Buchanan knows the monster killed the child. He implores Frankenstein to come forward and reveal the truth, but Frankenstein refuses. Buchanan then asks Shelley for help, telling her that he is from the future. They are attracted to each other, but Mary, fearing to know too much about the future and her own destiny, chooses not to become involved. Buchanan is on his own. He drives his car to Frankenstein's workshop and finds the doctor in discussion with the monster.
The monster has killed Frankenstein's fiance, saying that if a mate was not made for him then he would deprive Frankenstein of his. Frankenstein asks Buchanan to use his knowledge of electricity to assist in resurrecting the dead woman. Buchanan instructs the monster to run cables to a weather vane on the roof. While the monster is distracted, Buchanan re-routes some of the electrical cables to begin powering up the prototype laser in his car.
As the lightning strikes the tower again and again, the battery on the laser begins to charge and the corpse on the table begins to move. At the same moment, the woman is restored to life and Buchanan's energy beam is fully charged; he fires. The castle is destroyed.
But the laser opens another space-time rift, sending Buchanan, Frankenstein and the two monsters far into the future. They land on a snowy mountain with no sign of civilization. Frankenstein and the monster both try to entice the woman to them, only to have her force Frankenstein to shoot and kill her. Enraged, the monster kills Frankenstein and trudges off into the snowstorm. Buchanan follows, hoping to kill the monster before he reaches a city and kills again.
Eventually the monster is cornered in a cave filled with computers and machines. When Buchanan enters, the machines chirp to life and a voice says ""Welcome back, Dr. Buchanan."" The monster tells Buchanan that the cave is the central brain for the nearby city, the last one remaining after the world has been devastated by Buchanan's ultimate weapon. Buchanan engages security devices and the monster is burned to death by lasers. Buchanan makes his way to the nearby city through the snow.
As he walks, the monster's voice is heard saying that he cannot truly be killed, for now he is ""unbound.""",horror dr buchanan team work develop ultimate weapon energy beam completely remove aim buchanan hope create weapon powerful end war add benefit impact environment unfortunately prototype unpredictable effect create erratic global weather pattern rift space time cause people vanish drive home testing facility buchanan catch rift buchanan futuristic computer control car reappear switzerland village meet victor frankenstein man discuss science dinner reveal frankenstein young brother kill trial determine guilt innocence boy nanny suspect murder villager claim see monster wood suggest killer buchanan observe trial interested young woman take note turn mary shelley author frankenstein novel shelley give credence talk monster judge nanny find guilty sentence die gallow buchanan know monster kill child implore frankenstein come forward reveal truth frankenstein refuse buchanan ask shelley help tell future attract mary fear know future destiny choose involve buchanan drive car frankenstein workshop find doctor discussion monster monster kill frankenstein fiance say mate deprive frankenstein frankenstein ask buchanan use knowledge electricity assist resurrect dead woman buchanan instruct monster run cable weather vane roof monster distract buchanan route electrical cable begin power prototype laser car lightning strike tower battery laser begin charge corpse table begin moment woman restore life buchanan energy beam fully charge fire castle destroy laser open space time rift send buchanan frankenstein monster far future land snowy mountain sign civilization frankenstein monster try entice woman force frankenstein shoot kill enraged monster kill frankenstein trudge snowstorm buchanan follow hope kill monster reach city kill eventually monster corner cave fill computer machine buchanan enter machine chirp life voice say welcome dr buchanan monster tell buchanan cave central brain nearby city remain world devastate buchanan ultimate weapon buchanan engage security device monster burn death laser buchanan make way nearby city snow walk monster voice hear say truly kill unbound
 Jeepers Creepers II,horror,"On its twenty-second day of feeding, the Creeper disguised as a scarecrow abducts young Billy Taggart in front of his father Jack, and older brother Jack Jr.
The next day, a school bus carrying a high school basketball team and cheerleaders suffers a blowout, after one of the tires is hit by a hand-crafted shuriken made of bone fragments. Later, cheerleader Minxie Hayes has a vision of Billy Taggart and Darry Jenner, the Creeper's victim from the first film, who attempt to warn her about the Creeper, before he blows out another tire, disabling the bus. With the team stranded, the Creeper abducts the bus driver and coaches. When he returns he singles out several of the students including Dante, Jake, Scotty, Bucky, and Double D. Minxie has another vision in which Darry says the Creeper emerges every twenty-third spring, for twenty-three days to eat humans, and she tells the other students.
After hearing several police reports, the Taggarts go hunting for the Creeper and soon make radio contact with the school bus. The Creeper attacks Bucky, but Rhonda stabs it through the head with a javelin. After decapitating Dante, The Creeper uses his severed head to replace its own. The students decide to leave the bus to find help, but the Creeper returns and chases them into a field, where the Creeper kills Jake and takes Scotty.
When The Creeper attacks Bucky on the bus again, Taggart arrives and shoots it with a home-made harpoon, but The Creeper fights off Taggart and manages to escape after flipping over the bus and Taggart's truck. Izzy, Rhonda, and Double D find a truck and attempt to escape but are chased by the Creeper again. Izzy pushes Rhonda out of the truck before causing the vehicle to crash, injuring both Double D and the Creeper, who loses an arm, a leg, and a wing. The Creeper continues to pursue Double D by leaping towards him and when it has Double D pinned down, Taggart shows up and shoots the Creeper in the head with the harpoon. He repeatedly stabs the Creeper in the chest but it goes into a hibernation state before it can die.
Twenty-three years later, a group of teenagers drive to Taggart's farm, where the Creeper is a sideshow attraction, called ""The Bat Out of Hell"". They see an elderly Taggart watching it with the harpoon at his side, and when they ask him if he is waiting for something, he looks up at the Creeper and says: “about three more days, give or take a day or two"".",horror second day feeding creeper disguise scarecrow abduct young billy taggart father jack old brother jack jr day school bus carry high school basketball team cheerleader suffer blowout tire hit hand craft shuriken bone fragment later cheerleader minxie hayes vision billy taggart darry jenner creeper victim film attempt warn creeper blow tire disable bus team strand creeper abduct bus driver coach return single student include dante jake scotty bucky double minxie vision darry say creeper emerge spring day eat human tell student hear police report taggart hunt creeper soon radio contact school bus creeper attack bucky rhonda stab head javelin decapitate dante creeper use severed head replace student decide leave bus find help creeper return chase field creeper kill jake take scotty creeper attack bucky bus taggart arrive shoot home harpoon creeper fight taggart manage escape flip bus taggart truck izzy rhonda double d find truck attempt escape chase creeper izzy push rhonda truck cause vehicle crash injure double d creeper lose arm leg wing creeper continue pursue double d leap double d pin taggart show shoot creeper head harpoon repeatedly stab creeper chest go hibernation state die year later group teenager drive taggart farm creeper sideshow attraction call bat hell elderly taggart watch harpoon ask wait look creeper say day day

Furry Vengeance,"comedy, family","In the wilderness of Oregon, a prairie dog screams after Riggs' (Rob Riggle) car passes by and throws a cigar at it. This causes an unnamed raccoon to signal a mink to release a boulder that pushes Riggs' car to the edge of a cliff, teetering back and forth. After that, the raccoon throws the cigar back to Riggs, who yells ""you're a bad raccoon!"". The raccoon then blows the car down the cliff. Riggs quits Lyman Enterprises.
As a result of Riggs' resignation, a real estate developer from Chicago named Dan Sanders (Brendan Fraser) is brought in as his replacement. He is given the task of turning the forest of Rocky Springs into a residential development by Lyman Enterprises CEO Neal Lyman (Ken Jeong). This all transpires much to the objections of Dan's son, Tyler (Matt Prokop). His wife Tammy (Brooke Shields) is unhappy in Rocky Springs, she misses her life in Chicago. Unfortunately for Dan, the animals who are led by the raccoon refuse to sit back and watch their forest to be destroyed.
They manage to turn the tables on him by disturbing his progress, interrupting his meetings, and humiliating him. Upon receiving some research from his love interest Amber (Skyler Samuels), Tyler tells his father that Rocky Springs is a forest reserve where he warns his father that ""many have tried to conquer it but they all fail."" Following an attack by a bear that traps him in a tipped over portable toilet, Dan signs orders to have a drill sergeant (Billy Bush) capture and cage all the animals.
Meanwhile, Tammy is forced to plan an ""eco friendly"" fair with a senile teacher Mrs. Martin (Alice Drummond) at the high school which is sponsored by Lyman's company, unaware of Lyman's plans to cut down the forest to build houses and a shopping mall ""with a forest theme"". Dan, figuring this out, decides to set the animals free. Once released the raccoon and his friends immediately wreak havoc on the eco fair, causing the guests and entertainers to flee while Mrs. Martin talks to an owl.
Lyman accidentally tranquilizes the sponsor for the construction, Mr. Gupta (Gerry Bednob), after he attempted to break their deal. He flees into a worm tunnel with the animals in close pursuit. The animals began attacking him, as a bear drives a golf cart, pulling the tunnel away into a bush. After some convincing from Amber and Tammy, Tyler finally tells his father that he loves him. Three months later, the forest is reclaimed as a nature preserve with Dan working as a park ranger. The poster promoting the forest preservation also states that anyone who violates the rules will be fined $1,000,000.00.

A Bone for a Bone,animation,"The Gophers (Mac and Tosh) are playing a gin game in their hole in the ground outside a house, where Tosh loses his fifth game in a row, when Geo P. Dog digs a hole and dumps a bone on the Gophers and then dirt as he fills the hole in. Geo does remove the bone upon Tosh's request, but realizing that it was gophers who asked him to move the bone, he returns to the same hole to rebury the bone. This time, Mac goes up, only to be grabbed by Geo. Mac then yells for help, which arrives in the form of Tosh and a hammer, which Tosh uses to knock Geo's head into his collar, allowing the Gophers to return to their hole and escape the dog, but not before the Gophers have an argument over who should enter the hole first.
As Geo then reaches into the hole to try to find the Gophers, the Gophers attach a fake hand to one end of a gray garden hose and a noose around the other end to fasten to the dog's actual hand. The hose is then brought out of another hole and extended out to the street, where it is quickly run over by a truck, leading the dog to believe he has been hurt until he finds Tosh behind him. After blocking two attempts by Tosh to get back into his hole, the dog challenges Tosh to come up with a trick, which he does: a card with firecracker that explodes, allowing Tosh to escape.
Furious, Geo then gets a can of TNT and pours it down the Gophers' hole. Mac then emerges from the other one and asks to borrow a match, to which Geo obliges, only to see the match used to light the pouring TNT and ignite it.

The Drum,adventure,"During the British Raj, Captain Carruthers (Roger Livesey) works under cover to track smuggled shipments of arms on the restless Northwest Frontier of India, the modern day Pakistan-Afghanistan border. He fears a full-scale rebellion is brewing. To forestall this, the British governor (Francis L. Sullivan) signs a treaty with the friendly, peace-loving ruler of Tokot, a key kingdom in the region, which is described as four days' march northward from Peshawar. In real life the British held a fort at Abazai near this location, not far from the famous Takht Bhai ruins. Meanwhile, the king's son, Prince Azim (Sabu), befriends Carruthers and a British drummer boy, Bill Holder (Desmond Tester), who teaches him how to play the instrument.
However, the king's brother, Prince Ghul (Raymond Massey), has the king assassinated and usurps the throne; Azim escapes a similar fate thanks to two loyal retainers. They hide out in Peshawar, where the British are based. When one of Ghul's men finds and tries to kill the prince, Azim is rescued by Carruthers' wife (Valerie Hobson). Although he is offered sanctuary, Azim declines, believing it to be safer to remain hidden among his own people.
Carruthers is then sent to negotiate with Ghul, who pretends to want to honour the treaty. In reality, Ghul is the mastermind behind the rebellion. He plots to kill Carruthers and his detachment of men on the last day of a festival to signal the start of the revolt. Prince Azim learns of the ambush. When he is unable to convince the governor, he chooses to risk his own life to warn his friends. After Azim leaves for home, the governor receives confirmation of the plot and sends four battalions to the rescue.
Azim manages to warn Carruthers of the impending massacre by playing a danger signal on the ""Sacred Drum of Tokot"", saving many British lives.

Safety Not Guaranteed,comedy,"Darius Britt (Aubrey Plaza) is a disillusioned college graduate who lives at home with her widower father (Jeff Garlin) and interns at Seattle Magazine. One of the magazine's writers, Jeff Schwensen (Jake Johnson), proposes to investigate a newspaper classified ad that reads:[8]
Jeff's boss Bridget (Mary Lynn Rajskub) approves of his story idea and Jeff selects his team: Darius and a man named Arnau (Karan Soni), a studious biology major interning at the magazine to diversify his resume. They travel to the seaside community of Ocean View to find and profile the person behind the ad. Jeff later reveals an ulterior motive for this assignment: to track down a long-lost love interest who lives in town.
Darius discovers that the person behind the ad is Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass), a stock clerk at a local grocery store. Jeff's attempt to approach Kenneth alienates him, so Jeff orders Darius to make contact. Darius' disaffected attitude serves her well, and she quickly endears herself to Kenneth as she poses as a candidate to accompany him on his mission. While Kenneth is paranoid and believes that ""secret agents"" are tracking his every move, Darius gains his trust as she participates in a series of training exercises in the woods around his house and begins to develop feelings for him. She tells Kenneth about losing her mother when she was young and that her mission is to prevent it. Kenneth says his mission is to go back to 2001 and prevent the death of his old girlfriend Belinda, who was killed when someone drove a car into her house.
Meanwhile, Jeff tracks down Liz (Jenica Bergere), his fling from his teenage years; although she is not as attractive as his memories of her younger self, they reconnect and sleep together. He asks her to come back with him to Seattle, but she believes this is just another fling for Jeff, so she refuses. Upset by her rejection, Jeff takes Arnau out on the town and they pick up some young women. Jeff tells Arnau to not waste his youth and convinces him to spend the night with one of the women.
The next morning, Jeff receives a phone call from Bridget, who has been following up the team's notes on the story; she informs him that Belinda (Kristen Bell) is still alive. During an interview, Darius learns Belinda was only friends with Kenneth and that Kenneth had driven into her then-boyfriend's house, but no one was injured. After the interview, Darius is questioned by two government agents who have been following Kenneth and believe that he may be a spy because of his communication with government scientists.
Darius returns to Kenneth's house to confront him about Belinda, but Kenneth rationalizes that his time traveling must have worked.

Asoka,history,"The film chronicles the early part of the life of Emperor Asoka. It begins with his career as a General in Taxila (modern-day Pakistan) and ends with the bloody conquest of the Kalinga country (modern day Odisha State)
Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, grandfather of Asoka, of the Maurya empire, has decided to embrace Jainism and abdicate the throne of the empire in favour of his son Bindusara. But his grandson, Prince Asoka, claims his sword. The old emperor explains that this sword is evil and the sword demands blood and destruction.
A few years later, Prince Asoka Maurya (Shah Rukh Khan), now a brave youth, is battling the rebellious chief of Taxila for his Emperor and father. He figures that his elder half-brother Susima Maurya (Ajith Kumar), who also has an eye on the throne of the empire, has deliberately withheld reinforcements from arriving, but defeats the enemy nevertheless. Asoka returns to the capital victorious and confronts Susima. Later, Susima tries to assassinate Asoka while he is bathing. The fight among the princes makes the Emperor unhappy and he orders Empress Dharma (Subhashini Ali) to control her son Asoka. She compels Asoka to temporarily leave the capital to lead the life of a common man. The Prince is disappointed but leaves nonetheless.
Asoka, alone and disguised as an ordinary traveller, rides to the south. In his travels, he meets a lovely maiden, Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor) and falls in love with her. He also develops a good relationship with her little brother Arya. They are on the run from the Kingdom of Kalinga along with their faithful protector Bheema (Rahul Dev) and are being chased by soldiers of the Kingdom. After saving their lives, Asoka introduces himself as Pawan, hiding his true identity. Kaurwaki and Arya are the Princess and Prince of Kalinga, who fled from their kingdom when the Prime Minister assassinated their parents and took over power. Later, Asoka and Kaurwaki get secretly married.
Soon, Asoka is summoned by his mother who sent a messenger to tell him she has fallen ill and to come to capital. The Emperor dispatches Asoka to quell a rebellion in Ujjaini. Before marching to the west, Asoka travels to Kalinga to meet Kaurwaki and Arya. Unable to find them, and not knowing they have gone into hiding, he is informed by General Bheema that they were slaughtered. A heartbroken Asoka attempts suicide, but is saved by Virat (Danny Denzongpa), who later swears to protect him. Mad with grief and anger, Asoka leads a brutal crackdown in Ujjaini. The assassins sent by Susima injure Asoka in a battle and Virat saves him. He is taken to a Buddhist monastery at Vidisa to recover.
There, he meets a Buddhist maiden, Devi (Hrishita Bhatt), who cares for him. Asoka also survives another assassination attempt at Vidisa, this time with the help of Devi. Asoka marries Devi and returns in splendour to Pataliputra. Susima and his brothers are wild with anger from their futile attempts to eliminate Asoka. Emperor Bindusara, who favoured Susima over Asoka, becomes ill and dies. In another vigilante attack, Queen Dharma is stabbed to death by assassins sent by Susima. Angered, Asoka wants to kill Susima but has second thoughts and Susima is killed by Virat when he tries to kill Asoka behind his back and is appointed emperor.
A few months later, princess Kaurwaki and prince Arya return to Kalinga with Bheema and have the Prime Minister executed for treason. Asoka declares war on Kalinga, not knowing that Kaurwaki is alive. Kaurwaki still does not know that Asoka is Pawan, and both sides prepare for war.
A terrible war is fought in Kalinga. The Maurya army inflicts a crushing defeat on Kalinga. Not content with mere victory, Maurya soldiers butcher everyone in sight. General Bheema is killed after failing to assassinate Asoka realizing that he is Pawan and Kaurwaki is wounded. Asoka later visits the battlefield, where he discovers his horse, who was supposed to be in Kaurwaki's possession. With a surge of hope, he frantically searches for Kaurwaki and finds her. They have a heart-to-heart talk and he apologises deeply for his actions. He is interrupted by Arya, who is dying after being pierced with arrows. With Arya dying in his arms, Asoka suddenly realises that his enemies, his family, and even Arya, are all dead because of him. His grandfather's warning about the sword had been correct.
The film ends with Asoka throwing the sword into the water at the same spot as his grandfather, and embracing Buddhism. The final narrative describes how Asoka not only built a large empire but spread Buddhism and the winds of peace throughout the empire.",history film chronicle early life emperor asoka begin career general taxila modern day pakistan end bloody conquest kalinga country modern day odisha state emperor chandragupta maurya grandfather asoka maurya empire decide embrace jainism abdicate throne empire favour son bindusara grandson prince asoka claim sword old emperor explain sword evil sword demand blood destruction year later prince asoka maurya shah rukh khan brave youth battle rebellious chief taxila emperor father figure eld half brother susima maurya ajith kumar eye throne empire deliberately withhold reinforcement arrive defeat enemy asoka return capital victorious confront susima later susima try assassinate asoka bathe fight prince make emperor unhappy order empress dharma subhashini ali control son asoka compel asoka temporarily leave capital lead life common man prince disappoint leave nonetheless asoka disguise ordinary traveller ride south travel meet lovely maiden kaurwaki kareena kapoor fall love develop good relationship little brother arya run kingdom kalinga faithful protector bheema rahul dev chase soldier kingdom save life asoka introduce pawan hide true identity kaurwaki arya princess prince kalinga flee kingdom prime minister assassinate parent take power later asoka kaurwaki secretly marry soon asoka summon mother send messenger tell fall ill come capital emperor dispatch asoka quell rebellion ujjaini march west asoka travel kalinga meet kaurwaki arya unable find know go hiding inform general bheema slaughter heartbroken asoka attempt suicide save virat danny denzongpa later swear protect mad grief anger asoka lead brutal crackdown ujjaini assassin send susima injure asoka battle virat save take buddhist monastery vidisa recover meet buddhist maiden devi hrishita bhatt care asoka survive assassination attempt vidisa time help devi asoka marrie devi return splendour pataliputra susima brother wild anger futile attempt eliminate asoka emperor bindusara favour susima asoka ill die vigilante attack queen dharma stab death assassin send susima anger asoka want kill susima second thought susima kill virat try kill asoka appoint emperor month later princess kaurwaki prince arya return kalinga bheema prime minister execute treason asoka declare war kalinga know kaurwaki alive kaurwaki know asoka pawan side prepare war terrible war fight kalinga maurya army inflict crush defeat kalinga content mere victory maurya soldier butcher sight general bheema kill fail assassinate asoka realizing pawan kaurwaki wound asoka later visit battlefield discover horse suppose kaurwaki possession surge hope frantically search kaurwaki find heart heart talk apologise deeply action interrupt arya die pierce arrow arya die arm asoka suddenly realise enemy family arya dead grandfather warning sword correct film end asoka throw sword water spot grandfather embrace buddhism final narrative describe asoka build large empire spread buddhism wind peace empire
Take My Life,thriller,"Nicholas ""Nicky"" Talbot attends the London debut of his wife, opera singer Philippa Shelley, at Covent Garden. After her successful performance, Nicky runs into former girlfriend Elizabeth Rusman backstage, a musician in the orchestra, who asks for his help. She gives him her address before Philippa appears (and keeps his personalised pencil). At home, Nicky and a jealous Philippa quarrel over Elizabeth. When Philippa throws an object that strikes her husband in the forehead, he leaves in a huff.
The scene then shifts to a courtroom, where the prosecuting counsel reveals that Nicky is on trial for the strangulation of Elizabeth that night. A flashback shows the murderer setting fire to the body. When the killer leaves the flat, he conceals his face from a man using a handkerchief pressed to his forehead, leading the police to assume he has been injured there. Also, the pencil is found at the scene of the crime. The police take Nicky into custody.
Philippa goes to see Elizabeth's mother in Holland, then to an employment agency and Elizabeth's acquaintances, without any progress. Inspector Archer does, however, let her examine the dead woman's possessions and copy a bit of music. When Philippa plays it at home, she discovers that her nephew is already familiar with it.
She sets out for a school in Scotland, having ascertained that one of the masters may be the composer. Mr. Flemming, the headmaster, is disturbed to recognise her from her photograph in the newspaper. He takes her on a tour of the school. She notices that the school group photograph for the previous year is missing. When she plays the tune on the chapel organ, she sees in a mirror that he is perturbed. Philippa obtains a copy of the photograph the next morning and sees Elizabeth in it. Flemming becomes aware of this and follows her aboard the train. He confronts her in her compartment. They are interrupted when a man enters, but when the newcomer reveals that he is deaf, Flemming confesses to the crime, though it was unpremeditated. Elizabeth had threatened to divorce him for cruelty, which would have ruined him. After the deaf man leaves, Flemming destroys the incriminating photograph and tries to throw Philippa from the train. Fortunately, the deaf man returns just in time. Flemming then jumps to his death.
When Philippa goes to see Inspector Archer (still without proof), he introduces her to Detective Sergeant Hawkins, the ""deaf"" man who is not deaf at all and therefore heard Flemming's confession.",thriller nicholas nicky talbot attend london debut wife opera singer philippa shelley covent garden successful performance nicky run girlfriend elizabeth rusman backstage musician orchestra ask help give address philippa appear keep personalised pencil home nicky jealous philippa quarrel elizabeth philippa throw object strike husband forehead leave huff scene shift courtroom prosecute counsel reveal nicky trial strangulation elizabeth night flashback show murderer set fire body killer leave flat conceal face man handkerchief press forehead lead police assume injure pencil find scene crime police nicky custody philippa go elizabeth mother holland employment agency elizabeth acquaintance progress inspector archer let examine dead woman possession copy bit music philippa play home discover nephew familiar set school scotland having ascertain master composer mr flemming headmaster disturb recognise photograph newspaper take tour school notice school group photograph previous year miss play tune chapel organ see mirror perturb philippa obtain copy photograph morning see elizabeth flemme aware follow aboard train confront compartment interrupt man enter newcomer reveal deaf flemme confesse crime unpremeditated elizabeth threaten divorce cruelty ruin deaf man leave flemme destroy incriminate photograph try throw philippa train fortunately deaf man return time flemme jump death philippa go inspector archer proof introduce detective sergeant hawkin deaf man deaf hear flemming confession
Talk Radio,drama,"Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio personality in Dallas, Texas, is a host with a caustic sense of humor and a knack for condescending his audience with his controversial politically left-wing views.
Champlain's radio show is about to go nationwide. A former suit salesman, he achieves his rise to fame through guest shots on the Jeff Fisher radio show. Barry begins to steal the show with his acerbic sense of humor and sharp wit, which aggravates Fisher. Barry is subsequently given his own show which rises to the top of the Arbitron radio ratings. Barry receives calls from people who appreciate him for what he does and how he does it as well as people who seem to hate him. Attacking everyone from gays to drug addicts to rednecks to African Americans, he has a substantial number of hostile callers, from people who take offense to his attitude to radical right wingers to hate groups phoning in to harass and intimidate him. He receives threatening fan mail when one caller makes a bomb threat. His rise to fame is accompanied not only with attention from radical far-right elements, but also with the alienation of his wife.
As his show is going through a final audition to go into national syndication, Barry grows increasingly isolated and asks his ex-wife Ellen to come and visit him, saying he needs her input and that she's the only person he trusts. They attempt a return to their relationship. Using a fake name and calling from the radio studio, Ellen talks to Barry on the air—the only place he seems to relate to people openly—in an attempt to reach him, to bring him back from the depression he seems to be suffering from. She begs for him to come back, but Barry refuses, bitterly attacking her as the radio production staff, all friends of Ellen, watch in horror; Ellen walks away. Barry confesses his true intentions, admitting he cares more for personal gain than the societal ills he addresses and refusing to apologize for his hypocrisy. He shouts that the American people scare him because of what has happened to his friends, family, and co-workers. He berates his callers that they have nothing worth saying, and that they tolerate his abuse and return for more. He screams at them to go away, seemingly unaware of the obvious fact that he attracts his own listeners and most of the ire he receives. In the end he realizes he has made his own bed and is as stuck with them as they are with him. Despite Barry's meltdown, his co-workers tell him it's now the highest rated segment in the show's history and his boss adds that the show is going to go national.
While walking to his car, an apparent fan asks for his autograph. As Barry signs it, the ""fan"" pulls out a gun and shoots him several times, killing him. As the film ends, callers to Barry's show, then his co-workers and Ellen, speak on air about him. They say that Barry was a talented, smart and funny man, but maybe he finally pushed someone too far.",drama barry champlain jewish radio personality dallas texas host caustic sense humor knack condescend audience controversial politically left wing view champlain radio nationwide suit salesman achieve rise fame guest shot jeff fisher radio barry begin steal acerbic sense humor sharp wit aggravate fisher barry subsequently give rise arbitron radio rating barry receive call people appreciate people hate attack gay drug addict redneck african americans substantial number hostile caller people offense attitude radical right winger hate group phone harass intimidate receive threaten fan mail caller make bomb threat rise fame accompany attention radical far right element alienation wife go final audition national syndication barry grow increasingly isolated ask ex wife ellen come visit say need input person trust attempt return relationship fake call radio studio ellen talk barry air place relate people openly attempt reach bring depression suffer beg come barry refuse bitterly attack radio production staff friend ellen watch horror ellen walk away barry confess true intention admit care personal gain societal ill address refuse apologize hypocrisy shout american people scare happen friend family co worker berate caller worth say tolerate abuse return scream away seemingly unaware obvious fact attract listener ire receive end realize bed stick despite barry meltdown co worker tell highest rate segment history boss add go national walk car apparent fan ask autograph barry sign fan pull gun shoot time kill film end caller barry co worker ellen speak air barry talented smart funny man maybe finally push far
The Dunwich Horror,horror,"A woman groans and writhes with the pain of childbirth in a bedroom from a bygone era as two elderly women - who appear to be twins - and an elderly man watch. She is then led out of the room by the elderly man.
At the Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts, Dr. Henry Armitage has just finished a lecture on the local history and the very rare and priceless book known as the Necronomicon. He gives the book to his student Nancy Wagner to return to the library. She is followed by a stranger, who later introduces himself as Wilbur Whateley. Wilbur asks to see the book, and though it is closing time and the book is reputedly the only copy in existence, Nancy allows it under the influence of his hypnotic gaze.
Wilbur's perusal of the book is cut short by Henry, who has researched Wilbur's family's sordid past. His warnings about the Whateley's go unheeded by Nancy, who decides to give Wilbur a ride back to Dunwich after he misses his bus, perhaps purposely. At a gas station on the outskirts of town, Nancy first encounters the ill-esteem in which the locals hold Wilbur.
Once back at the Whateley house, she meets Old Whateley, Wilbur's grandfather. Her car is then disabled and she is drugged by Wilbur. She decides under the influence of hypnosis and drugs to spend the weekend, and does not change her mind when Henry and Nancy's classmate Elizabeth arrive from Arkham the next morning. The duo does not abandon Nancy, however. They investigate further and discover that Wilbur's mother, Lavinia, is still alive and in an asylum. The town doctor, Dr. Cory informs Henry that Lavinia delivered twins when Wilbur was born, but one was stillborn, though he was not there for the delivery and never saw the body. The childbirth was very traumatic and Lavinia ""lost her mind"" during it, and nearly died.
In the meantime, on the advice of the locals, Elizabeth enters the Whateley house looking for Nancy. She opens a locked door, and releases a creature which appears to be Wilbur's monstrous twin, who kills her and escapes. Upon Wilbur and Nancy's return, Old Whateley confronts them about the presence of the Nancy's car, and in the ensuing argument, falls down the stairs and dies. Wilbur takes him to the local cemetery for a decidedly non-Christian burial, but the local townsfolk vociferously stop him.
Wilbur's twin runs amok in Dunwich, killing several people. Lavinia dies in the asylum, looking much older than her 45 years. The Whateley estate burns down in a conflagration that may have to do with a pagan ritual. At the top of a coastal cliff, Wilbur prepares Nancy for sacrifice to bring back what he calls ""The Old Ones."" Confronted by Armitage, Wilbur chants and calls down his demon father as his adversary chants reverse spells. Wilbur is struck by lightning in the ritual and falls in a ball of fire into the sea.
Finally, the physically unharmed Nancy is escorted off the sacrificial altar by Armitage and Cory, who calm her by stating that the Whateley line has ended. Nancy is pregnant, presumably with Wilbur's ill-conceived child.",horror woman groan writhe pain childbirth bedroom bygone era elderly woman appear twin elderly man watch lead room elderly man miskatonic university arkham massachusetts dr henry armitage finish lecture local history rare priceless book know necronomicon give book student nancy wagner return library follow stranger later introduce wilbur whateley wilbur ask book close time book reputedly copy existence nancy allow influence hypnotic gaze wilbur perusal book cut short henry research wilbur family sordid past warning whateley unheede nancy decide wilbur ride dunwich miss bus purposely gas station outskirt town nancy encounter ill esteem local hold wilbur whateley house meet old whateley wilbur grandfather car disabled drug wilbur decide influence hypnosi drug spend weekend change mind henry nancy classmate elizabeth arrive arkham morning duo abandon nancy investigate discover wilbur mother lavinia alive asylum town doctor dr cory informs henry lavinia deliver twin wilbur bear stillborn delivery see body childbirth traumatic lavinia lose mind nearly die meantime advice local elizabeth enter whateley house look nancy open locked door release creature appear wilbur monstrous twin kill escape wilbur nancy return old whateley confront presence nancy car ensue argument fall stair die wilbur take local cemetery decidedly non christian burial local townsfolk vociferously stop wilbur twin run amok dunwich kill people lavinia die asylum look old year whateley estate burn conflagration pagan ritual coastal cliff wilbur prepare nancy sacrifice bring call old one confront armitage wilbur chant call demon father adversary chant reverse spell wilbur strike lightning ritual fall ball fire sea finally physically unharmed nancy escort sacrificial altar armitage cory calm state whateley line end nancy pregnant presumably wilbur ill conceive child

Lolita,drama,"In 1947, Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons), a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith), largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores (Dominique Swain), also called ""Lo"", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls ""nymphets""), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter.
Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed. Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames ""Lolita"". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty (Frank Langella), who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, whose name Humbert doesn't know and searches for them unsuccessfully.
Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films.

Breaking Away,"drama, comedy","Dave, Mike, Cyril, and Moocher are working-class friends living in the college town of Bloomington, Indiana. Now turning 19, they all graduated from high school the year before and are not sure what to do with their lives. They spend much of their time together swimming in an old abandoned water-filled quarry. They sometimes clash with the more affluent Indiana University students in their hometown, who habitually refer to them as ""cutters"", a derogatory term for locals related to the local Indiana Limestone industry and the stonecutters who worked the quarries.
Dave is obsessed with competitive bicycle racing, and Italian racers in particular, because he recently won a Masi bicycle. His down-to-earth father Ray, a former stonecutter who now operates his own used car business (sometimes unethically), is puzzled and exasperated by his son's love of Italian music and culture, which Dave associates with cycling. However, his mother Evelyn is more understanding and prepares Italian dishes for him.
Dave develops a crush on a university student named Katherine and masquerades as an Italian exchange student in order to romance her. One evening, he serenades ""Katerina"" outside her sorority house (Friedrich von Flotow's aria ""M' Apparì Tutt' Amor""), with Cyril providing guitar accompaniment. When her boyfriend Rod finds out, he and some of his fraternity brothers beat Cyril up, mistaking him for Dave. Though Cyril wants no trouble, Mike insists on tracking down Rod and starting a brawl. The university president (real-life then President Dr. John W. Ryan) reprimands the students for their arrogance toward the ""cutters"" and, over their objections, invites the latter to participate in the annual Indiana University Little 500 race.
When a professional Italian cycling team comes to town for a race, Dave is thrilled to be competing with them. However, the Italians become irked when Dave is able to keep up with them. One of them jams a tire pump in Dave's wheel, causing him to crash, which leaves him disillusioned. He is depressed to realize that the Italians were winning races because they were cheating. He subsequently confesses his deception to Katherine, who tearfully slaps him before storming off.
Dave's friends persuade him to join them in forming a cycling team for the Little 500. Dave's parents provide T-shirts with the name ""Cutters"" on them. Ray privately tells his son how, when he was a young stonecutter, he was proud to help provide the material to construct the university, yet he never felt comfortable on campus. Later, Dave runs into Katherine, who's going to be leaving for a job in Chicago; they patch things up, and she wishes him luck in the race.
Dave is so much better than the other competitors in the Little 500 that, while the college teams switch cyclists every few laps, he rides without a break and builds up a sizable lead. However, he is injured in a crash and has to stop. After some hesitation, Moocher, Cyril, and Mike take turns pedaling, but soon the Cutters' lead vanishes. Finally Dave has them tape his feet to the pedals and starts to make up lost ground; he overtakes Rod, the current rider for the favored fraternity team, on the last lap, and wins for the jubilant Cutters.
Ray is proud of his son's accomplishment and takes to riding a bicycle himself. Dave later enrolls at the university, where he meets a pretty French student. Soon, he is extolling to her the virtues of the Tour de France and French cyclists.",drama comedy dave mike cyril moocher working class friend live college town bloomington indiana turn graduate high school year sure life spend time swim old abandon water fill quarry clash affluent indiana university student hometown habitually refer cutter derogatory term local relate local indiana limestone industry stonecutter work quarry dave obsess competitive bicycle racing italian racer particular recently win masi bicycle earth father ray stonecutter operate car business unethically puzzle exasperate son love italian music culture dave associate cycling mother evelyn understanding prepare italian dish dave develop crush university student name katherine masquerade italian exchange student order romance evening serenade katerina outside sorority house friedrich von flotow aria m apparì tutt amor cyril provide guitar accompaniment boyfriend rod find fraternity brother beat cyril mistake dave cyril want trouble mike insist track rod start brawl university president real life president dr john ryan reprimand student arrogance cutter objection invite participate annual indiana university little race professional italian cycling team come town race dave thrill compete italians irk dave able jam tire pump dave wheel cause crash leave disillusioned depressed realize italians win race cheat subsequently confess deception katherine tearfully slap storm dave friend persuade join form cycling team little dave parent provide t shirt cutter ray privately tell son young stonecutter proud help provide material construct university feel comfortable campus later dave run katherine go leave job chicago patch thing wish luck race dave well competitor little college team switch cyclist lap ride break build sizable lead injure crash stop hesitation moocher cyril mike turn pedal soon cutter lead vanishe finally dave tape foot pedal start lose ground overtake rod current rider favor fraternity team lap win jubilant cutter ray proud son accomplishment take ride bicycle dave later enroll university meet pretty french student soon extoll virtue tour de france french cyclist
Secondhand Lions,comedy-drama,"14-year-old Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is left by his irresponsible mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgwick), to live for the summer with his reclusive, bachelor great-uncles, Hub (Robert Duvall) and Garth (Michael Caine). Despite living on a ramshackle Texan farm, they are said to have a secret fortune and are made the target of every traveling salesman. They, in turn, sit on their porch with shotguns, the salesmen their targets.
Walter is given a room in the attic and is not welcomed at first, until they realize he annoys other gold-digging relatives who visit with their children. For his part, Walter persuades his uncles to try spending some of their money, generally with disastrous results. Packets of seeds to plant a vegetable garden turn out all to be corn. Then they order a lion for an animal target and end up with an aging, tame lioness, which they turn over to Walter as a pet. Later, it is released by accident and takes to the cornfield, which becomes her new ""jungle"" home. While loading 50-pound bags of Lion Chow, Hub passes out and is taken to the hospital. On leaving, they encounter four greasers at a roadside store who draw switchblade knives on Hub, but are easily beaten by him in a fight.
A subplot develops around the photograph of a beautiful woman that Walter finds in the attic. In a series of flashbacks, Garth tells Walter the story of their African past, during which Hub fell in love with an Arab princess promised to a powerful Sheik. When they married, the Sheik put a price on Hub's head, keeping them in constant peril from assassins. Finally Hub won a duel against the Sheik but spared his life, warning him to cease the manhunt. When Walter asks to hear more from Hub, his uncle reveals that Jasmine died in childbirth. Hub then returned to the French Foreign Legion, until he retired with Garth to their farm, where they are resignedly waiting to die. Walter asks Hub for confirmation, since his mother always lies to him. Hub responds with a piece of his ""What Every Boy Needs to Know..."" speech, that the actual truth is not as important as belief in ideals. Walter then asks Hub to promise to be around to give him the rest of the speech when he's old enough and Hub grudgingly agrees.
Late one evening, Walter trails Garth and discovers they have a room filled with money underneath the barn. On another night, Walter's mother and her current boyfriend, a supposed ""private investigator"", arrive. While the uncles sleep, Stan and Mae demand that Walter reveal the location of his uncles' fortune, claiming they were actually bank robbers. When Walter chooses to believe in his uncles instead, Stan pins Walter down and begins beating him. Sensing that he is in danger, the lioness emerges from the cornfield and mauls Stan. Awakened by the ruckus, Hub and Garth find the old lioness has died of heart failure defending her “cub”.
The next day, Walter leaves with his mother. Once on the road, Mae explains that Stan will be staying with them to recuperate, but Walter asks her instead to ""do something that's best for me for once"" and abandons her. While Hub and Garth are delighted to see him back, Walter insists there have to be changes: His uncles must involve themselves in his education and live carefully, as he wants them to die of old age.
Seventeen years later, Walter is alerted by the sheriff of his uncles' deaths from a failed flying stunt with their biplane. Arriving at the farm, he is given his uncles' will, declaring ""The kid gets it all. Just plant us in the damn garden, with the stupid lion."" A helicopter bearing the logo Sahara Petroleum then touches down near the homestead and a man steps out with his young son, explaining that he heard about Hub and Garth's deaths on the radio. He had recognized the names as the two Americans in tales told to him in his youth by his grandfather, ""a very wealthy sheik"". When the man's young son asks Walter if his uncles were real, Walter confirms, ""Yeah.

My Life,drama,"Detroit, Michigan, 1963: Bob Ivanovich, a young son of Ukrainian-American[3][4] parents, prays one night for a circus in his backyard the next day after school. After school the next day, he runs home eagerly, followed by his friends. To his disappointment, no circus awaits. Angrily, Bob retreats to the closet in his room, his personal retreat space.
Bob has shunned his Ukrainian-born parents for their immigrant ways and decided to move away from his family in Detroit.[4] Thirty years later, Bob Jones (Keaton) now runs a Los Angeles public relations firm. He is happily married to Gail (Kidman), who is pregnant with their first child. Bob is horrified to learn that he has been diagnosed with a terminal form of kidney cancer and might not live to see their baby born.
Bob begins to make home movies, to immortalize himself, to be shown after his death to his son, so he'll know who his father was, showing him how to cook spaghetti, how to drive, etc. He also begins to visit a Chinese healer named Mr. Ho (Dr. Haing S. Ngor), who urges him to listen to his heart, which is calling him to forgive, and that life is always giving him invitations if he would just listen. At his wife's urging, they fly to his hometown of Detroit to attend a traditional Ukrainian wedding of his brother Paul (Whitford). While in the area, Bob visits his childhood home. Also while there, they attempt to mend fences with his estranged family, which does not go well. Bob criticizes his brother for not moving to California like he did, and his father (Constantine) resents Bob's moving thousands of miles away and changing his name.
Bob returns to California with a heavy heart, sadly saying to his wife, ""This is my last trip home."" During a visit with Mr. Ho, he advises Bob to go into his heart ""soon."" Bob teaches his son by camera how to shave, play basketball, and start a car by jumper cable. He also confronts a childhood fear by finally riding a formidable roller coaster. During the ride, a young companion urges him to let go of the railing as the descent begins, but Bob firmly holds on. (A metaphor of his fear of letting go of life.) He is living on borrowed time—beyond the date the doctors gave him, as he says to his wife after getting off the coaster, ""Today is D-Day. Death Day. I was supposed to be dead by today.""
Gail's contractions increase, and soon she is in the hospital, to give birth to their baby. Bob and Gail have a happy time with their newborn, but soon Bob's condition worsens, now that the cancer has reached his brain. Hospice care is arranged for Bob. Bob makes a final visit to Mr. Ho, and asks him what the light is he keeps seeing. Mr. Ho replies it is ""the life of the self"" and urges him to get his ""house in order (life and personal affairs).""
A hospice nurse, Theresa (Queen Latifah), moves in to help, but Bob is sinking fast. Bob and Gail finally call his family to inform them of what's going on. Bob's family comes west for the first time to visit. Bob makes peace with his family at last. Bob's childhood wish is finally granted by a circus in the backyard.
As his father shaves him, Bob shows that he has at last made peace by telling his father he loves him. Bob finally comes to terms with his life as he dies peacefully, surrounded by the loving, supportive bosom of his family. Next is shown Bob on a metaphysical roller coaster, this time letting go of the railing, raising his arms freely in the air this time, metaphorically letting go of life, and finally enjoying the ride of life.

Grave Encounters,sci-fi horror,"Jerry Hartfield, the producer of Grave Encounters, a famous ghost investigation television series, explains that Grave Encounters was cancelled in 2003 after the fifth episode, when the cast and crew, along with the footage for episode six, mysteriously went missing. The footage was finally recovered in 2010 and brought to Hartfield. In it, the show's host Lance Preston, along with occult specialist Sasha Parker, surveillance operator Matt White, cameraman T.C. Gibson, and fake medium Houston Grey, investigate the abandoned fictional mental asylum Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital, where many instances of paranormal activity have been reported since its closure after the head doctor, Dr. Arthur Friedkin, is charged with inhumane experiments on the patients.
After taking a day tour of the hospital, the crew return for an overnight surveillance campaign while locking themselves inside. At first, everything is quiet, but soon, strange phenomena begin to occur, such as odd noises, doors and windows moving, and a wheelchair moving on its own. After recording a haunting where an invisible entity moves Sasha's hair, the group decides to finish their filming and wait for 6 AM when the caretaker will let them out. They begin gathering their belongings, but Matt disappears while retrieving the cameras alone.
Now becoming uneasy and with the caretaker nowhere to be seen hours after their agreed release time, the crew eventually break down the exit doors, only to discover that the exit mysteriously loops back into another hallway, and all exits either lead to more hallways. Lance soon realizes that the sun has not risen, and it is still night outside, despite their cellphone clocks showing that it is well past mid-morning. The group attempts to find an alternate exit, but to no avail as the building seemingly changes around them, creating dead ends and false exits. While the group is sleeping again, someone scratches the word ""HELLO"" into Sasha's back. After the group encounters a young woman in a hospital gown whose face demonically distorts, Houston is separated and strangled by an invisible force. A flash of light follows, and Houston is thrown back, dead. While resting, the remaining crew awaken only to discover that they have somehow been fitted with hospital identification bracelets, each bracelet having their name inscribed on it.
Lance, Sasha, and T.C. eventually find Matt in a room, wearing a hospital gown and appears to be mentally unstable. As the group leaves the room, T.C. notices Matt remaining in the room, staring at a blood-filled bathtub. He tries to pull Matt away, but is dragged by a dead patient into the bathtub in which they both disappear. With Matt in tow, Lance and Sasha find an elevator, and Lance goes alone to find something to wedge to elevator door open. After taking a pipe from an old hospital gurney he encounters a demonic patient. Lance panics, flees to the elevator, and pries the elevator door open. He is then attacked by the patient, but Sasha rescues him.
Meanwhile, Matt videos his suicide by jumping down the elevator shaft while Lance and Sasha are occupied. After climbing down a ladder in the shaft to the underground tunnels of the hospital, Sasha becomes violently ill and starts coughing up blood. The two stop to rest, and while they sleep, Sasha is covered by a strange mist and disappears. Lance alone wanders down the seemingly endless corridors as his mental health spirals downward, feeding on rats to survive.
Eventually, Lance encounters a door that appears seemingly out of nowhere, which leads to Dr. Friedkin's legendary secret operating room. There, he finds evidence of satanic rituals and black magic being performed on the patients. Lance then discovers a small sacrificial altar on the floor, after which he is attacked by the ghost of Friedkin, who drags him away as he screams, before the camera cuts out. The camera is turned back on, showing Lance alive, implied to have been lobotomized by Friedkin. He states to the camera, ""He said I'm all better now...I can finally go home."" Followed by his famous outro. ""For Grave Encounters...Lance Preston signing off."" The screen then cuts to black.",sci fi horror jerry hartfield producer grave encounter famous ghost investigation television series explain grave encounter cancel fifth episode cast crew footage episode mysteriously go missing footage finally recover bring hartfield host lance preston occult specialist sasha parker surveillance operator matt white cameraman gibson fake medium houston grey investigate abandon fictional mental asylum collingwood psychiatric hospital instance paranormal activity report closure head doctor dr arthur friedkin charge inhumane experiment patient take day tour hospital crew return overnight surveillance campaign lock inside quiet soon strange phenomenon begin occur odd noise door window move wheelchair move record haunting invisible entity move sasha hair group decide finish filming wait caretaker let begin gather belonging matt disappear retrieve camera uneasy caretaker see hour agree release time crew eventually break exit door discover exit mysteriously loop hallway exit lead hallway lance soon realize sun rise night outside despite cellphone clock show past mid morning group attempt find alternate exit avail building seemingly change create dead end false exit group sleep scratch word hello sasha group encounter young woman hospital gown face demonically distort houston separate strangle invisible force flash light follow houston throw dead rest remain crew awaken discover fit hospital identification bracelet bracelet have inscribe lance sasha eventually find matt room wear hospital gown appear mentally unstable group leave room notices matt remain room stare blood fill bathtub try pull matt away drag dead patient bathtub disappear matt tow lance sasha find elevator lance go find wedge elevator door open take pipe old hospital gurney encounter demonic patient lance panic flee elevator pry elevator door open attack patient sasha rescue matt video suicide jump elevator shaft lance sasha occupy climb ladder shaft underground tunnel hospital sasha violently ill start cough blood stop rest sleep sasha cover strange mist disappear lance wander seemingly endless corridor mental health spiral downward feed rat survive eventually lance encounter door appear seemingly lead dr friedkin legendary secret operating room find evidence satanic ritual black magic perform patient lance discover small sacrificial altar floor attack ghost friedkin drag away scream camera cut camera turn show lance alive imply lobotomize friedkin state camera say well finally home follow famous outro grave encounter lance preston signing screen cut black

Butterfly on a Wheel,thriller,"Chicago residents Neil Randall (Gerard Butler) and his wife, Abby Randall (Maria Bello) have the perfect life and a perfect marriage. With their beautiful young daughter, Sophie, they are living the American dream . . . until today. When Sophie is suddenly kidnapped, they have no choice but to comply with the abductor's demands. The kidnapper, Tom Ryan (Pierce Brosnan), an apparent sociopath, takes over their lives with the brutal efficiency of someone who has nothing to lose.
In the blink of an eye, Neil and Abby's safe and secure existence is turned upside down. Over the next twenty-four hours they will be at the mercy of a man who wants only one thing: that they do his bidding. Ryan's demands are all the more terrifying because he doesn't want their money. What he wants is Neil and Abby's life to be systematically dismantled and destroyed, piece by piece.
With time running out on their little girl, Neil and Abby realize they will have to submit to Ryan's challenges over the next 24-hour period. Tom asks them, how far will they go to save their child? He requires them to withdraw more than $100,000 from their bank, which Tom burns and throws into a river along with their wallets. Then he requires them to get $300 from nowhere in a part of the town where they don't have any friends. Abby pawns her bracelet and Neil his watch to get the $300. He then requires Abby to deliver a document to Neil's office within twenty minutes, and Tom shows Neil a copy of document that contains details of Neil's hacking into customer accounts, which if leaked will ruin Neil.

Infernal Affairs III,crime,"Infernal Affairs III uses parallel storytelling, flashing between the past and the present.
Undercover cop Chan Wing-yan seeks to uncover the link between Hong Kong triad boss Hon Sam and the mysterious Mainland Chinese gang leader Shen Cheng. Since Hon's ascension to the seat of triad boss was due to the death of his predecessor, Ngai Wing-hau, Hon is suspicious of all his men for fear they might usurp his position. He tests Chan's loyalty by ordering him to smash an ashtray on Shen's brother during a negotiation, resulting in Chan's arrest by Inspector Yeung Kam-wing. Yeung tells Chan that though Chan does not recognise him, he recognises Chan and he warns the latter to ""be careful"". Chan is released after both Hon and Shen fetch him at police headquarters.
Concurrently, Chan is prosecuted for violent behaviour. His superior, Superintendent Wong Chi-shing, persuades the court to allow Chan to seek therapy, leading him to meet therapist Lee Sum-yee. Hon asks Chan to deliver arms to Shen, but he and other triad members do not show up. When Chan delivers the cargo, Shen's men discover that the boxes are empty and open fire on Chan; Shen and Chan shoot each other in the limbs during the crossfire. Shen finds out that Chan is an undercover cop when Yeung unexpectedly arrives on the scene. Yeung tells Chan that Shen is also an undercover cop working for the Mainland authorities. Yeung also tells Chan that he gained top honours when he was in the police academy due to Chan's ""expulsion"". The three shake hands, wait for the chaos to subside, then leave.
Lau Kin-ming, Hon's former mole in the Hong Kong Police Force, has been demoted to administrative duty pending an investigation into the deaths of Chan and Inspector B. He falsely claims that B shot Chan in the head while holding him hostage, and that he killed B in retaliation. After months of investigation, Lau is transferred back to Internal Affairs, where he struggles to whitewash his past and cover his true identity. Lau later learns that Hon had previously planted five other moles in the police force, one of whom might be a fellow Security Division Inspector, Yeung. A battle of wits develops between Lau and Yeung, as each of them tries to discover the other's secret.
Meanwhile, Lau suffers from an identity collapse as he loses track of reality, wrestling with guilt over Chan's death and grappling with his impending divorce from his wife, Mary. His psychological trauma deteriorates to the point where he begins to see himself as Chan. As ""Chan"", Lau makes it a personal mission to apprehend Yeung, whom he sees as his former self. After witnessing an incident where Lau suffers a hallucination, Lee conducts a hypnosis on him and finds out that he was Hon's mole. Lau realises his folly and knocks Lee unconscious before escaping.
Lau steals tapes from Yeung's office safe, using spy cameras to determine the code. He thinks he hears recordings of Yeung relating information to Hon, and leads his team to the Security Division to arrest Yeung just as Shen arrives. Lau plays a tape recording, which is actually a conversation between him and Hon. When Lau's second-in-command tries to arrest him instead, Lau panics and draws his gun, killing Yeung. He is immediately shot by Shen and attempts suicide by shooting himself in the neck. During a search of Lau's office, a tape is found in his safe and played. It is a recording of the song sung by Tsai Chin, given to him by Hon's wife.
A series of flashbacks play: immediately after Chan's death, Shen and Yeung meet. Shen suspects Lau. Yeung breaks into Lau's office to find tape recordings of his conversations with Hon, proving that Shen is right.
Yeung is buried next to Chan in the police cemetery. Shen and Lee visit the graves and Shen says to Lee: ""Events change men, but men do not change events. But these two men are extraordinary because they changed events.""
Lau ends up crippled and catatonic, lost inside his own mind, haunted by the spirit of Mary (Hon Sam's wife, whom he had a crush on in Infernal Affairs II) and locked in his own ""continuous hell"". His divorced wife Mary visits and tells him, ""Our baby can say ""papa"" now."" Before the picture fades into the next scene, the camera pans down onto Lau's fingers tapping out in Morse code, ""H-E-L..."" (and then the start of another 'L' as the picture dims).
Before the film ends, there is one final flashback to the hi-fi shop scene in Infernal Affairs, where Lau is buying an audio system from Chan.",crime infernal affairs iii use parallel storytelling flash past present undercover cop chan wing yan seek uncover link hong kong triad boss hon sam mysterious mainland chinese gang leader shen cheng hon ascension seat triad boss death predecessor ngai wing hau hon suspicious man fear usurp position test chan loyalty order smash ashtray shen brother negotiation result chan arrest inspector yeung kam wing yeung tell chan chan recognise recognise chan warn careful chan release hon shen fetch police headquarters concurrently chan prosecute violent behaviour superior superintendent wong chi shing persuade court allow chan seek therapy lead meet therapist lee sum yee hon ask chan deliver arm shen triad member chan deliver cargo shen man discover box open fire chan shen chan shoot limb crossfire shen find chan undercover cop yeung unexpectedly arrive scene yeung tell chan shen undercover cop work mainland authority yeung tell chan gain honour police academy chan expulsion shake hand wait chaos subside leave lau kin ming hon mole hong kong police force demote administrative duty pende investigation death chan inspector falsely claim b shoot chan head hold hostage kill b retaliation month investigation lau transfer internal affair struggle whitewash past cover true identity lau later learn hon previously plant mole police force fellow security division inspector yeung battle wit develop lau yeung try discover secret lau suffer identity collapse lose track reality wrestle guilt chan death grapple impending divorce wife mary psychological trauma deteriorate point begin chan chan lau make personal mission apprehend yeung see self witness incident lau suffer hallucination lee conduct hypnosis find hon mole lau realise folly knock lee unconscious escape lau steal tape yeung office safe spy camera determine code think hear recording yeung relate information hon lead team security division arrest yeung shen arrive lau play tape recording actually conversation hon lau second command try arrest instead lau panic draw gun kill yeung immediately shoot shen attempt suicide shoot neck search lau office tape find safe play recording song sing tsai chin give hon wife series flashback play immediately chan death shen yeung meet shen suspects lau yeung break lau office find tape recording conversation hon prove shen right yeung bury chan police cemetery shen lee visit grave shen say lee event change man man change event man extraordinary change event lau end crippled catatonic lose inside mind haunt spirit mary hon sam wife crush infernal affairs ii lock continuous hell divorced wife mary visit tell baby papa picture fade scene camera pan lau finger tap morse code h e l start l picture dim film end final flashback hi fi shop scene infernal affair lau buy audio system chan

Shanghai Express,"adventure, drama","In 1931, China is embroiled in a civil war. Friends of British Captain Donald ""Doc"" Harvey (Clive Brook) envy him because the fabulously notorious Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich) is a fellow passenger on the express train from Peking to Shanghai. Because the name means nothing to him, they inform him that she is a ""coaster"" or ""woman who lives by her wits along the China coast"" – in other words, a courtesan. On the journey, Harvey encounters Lily, who turns out to be his former lover, Madeline. Five years earlier, she had played a trick on Harvey to gauge his love for her, but it backfired and he left her. She frankly informs him that, in the interim, ""It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily."" When Lily makes it clear that she still cares deeply for him, it becomes apparent that his feelings also have not changed when she inadvertently sees the watch she gave him with her photograph still in it.
Among the other passengers are fellow coaster Hui Fei (Anna May Wong), Lily's companion; Christian missionary Mr. Carmichael (Lawrence Grant), who at first condemns the two ""fallen women""; inveterate gambler Sam Salt (Eugene Pallette); opium dealer Eric Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz); boarding house keeper Mrs. Haggerty (Louise Closser Hale); French officer Major Lenard (Emile Chautard) and a mysterious Eurasian, Henry Chang (Warner Oland).
Chinese government soldiers board and search the train and apprehend a high-ranking rebel agent. Chang then makes his way to a telegraph office and sends a coded message. Later, the train is stopped and taken over by the rebel army and its powerful warlord, who turns out to be Chang. Chang begins to question the passengers, looking for someone important enough to exchange for his valued aide. He finds what he wants in Harvey, who is on his way to perform brain surgery on the Governor-General of Shanghai. Chang offers to take Shanghai Lily to his palace, but she claims she has reformed. When Chang refuses to accept her answer, Harvey breaks in and knocks him down. Because Chang needs Harvey alive, he swallows (but does not forget) the insult. Chang then has Hui Fei brought to him in his quarters, where he forces himself on her.
The government releases Chang's man, but Chang decides to blind Harvey for his insolence. Out of love, Lily offers herself in return for Harvey's safe release. Harvey remains unaware of the danger that he is in and of Lily's reason for going with Chang. Chang is stabbed to death by Hui Fei who tells Harvey what has transpired. Finding Lily, the trio boards the train and departs before the body is discovered. The missionary Carmichael, trusting his instincts, gets Lily to reveal the truth about saving Harvey. She insists that he not enlighten Harvey because love must go hand in hand with faith. When the train finally reaches Shanghai safely, Lily offers Harvey her love unconditionally but demands the same in return. Harvey finally breaks down and embraces her.",adventure drama china embroil civil war friend british captain donald doc harvey clive brook envy fabulously notorious shanghai lily marlene dietrich fellow passenger express train peke shanghai mean inform coaster woman live wit china coast word courtesan journey harvey encounter lily turn lover madeline year early play trick harvey gauge love backfire leave frankly inform interim take man change shanghai lily lily make clear care deeply apparent feeling change inadvertently see watch give photograph passenger fellow coaster hui fei anna wong lily companion christian missionary mr carmichael lawrence grant condemn fallen woman inveterate gambler sam salt eugene pallette opium dealer eric baum gustav von seyffertitz boarding house keeper mrs haggerty louise closser hale french officer major lenard emile chautard mysterious eurasian henry chang warner oland chinese government soldier board search train apprehend high rank rebel agent chang make way telegraph office send coded message later train stop take rebel army powerful warlord turn chang chang begin question passenger look important exchange value aide find want harvey way perform brain surgery governor general shanghai chang offer shanghai lily palace claim reform chang refuse accept answer harvey break knock chang need harvey alive swallow forget insult chang hui fei bring quarter force government release chang man chang decide blind harvey insolence love lily offer return harvey safe release harvey remain unaware danger lily reason go chang chang stab death hui fei tell harvey transpire find lily trio board train depart body discover missionary carmichael trust instinct get lily reveal truth save harvey insist enlighten harvey love hand hand faith train finally reach shanghai safely lily offer harvey love unconditionally demand return harvey finally break embrace
Jane Got a Gun,action western,"Jane and her husband Bill ""Ham"" Hammond live in an isolated house with their five-year-old daughter Katie. One day Ham returns home with several serious bullet wounds. As Jane is attending to his injuries, Ham tells her that ""the Bishop Boys are coming"". This is a gang of vicious criminals, led by John Bishop, that Ham himself used to ride with.
Realizing that she is going to need help in order to defend her home and family from the Bishops, as Ham's injuries have rendered him helpless, Jane takes her daughter to a place of safety, with a woman friend whom she trusts. She then rides to the home of a neighbor, Dan Frost, and asks him if he will help her to protect her property from the Bishop Boys. Dan, a somewhat surly man who lives in a squalid, dirty house, refuses to help. It is obvious from their brief conversation that there is some past history – and bitterness - between Dan and Jane.
Jane rides into town to buy guns and ammunition and hopefully find someone who will help her family. As she is leaving the gun shop, she is waylaid and dragged into an alley by one of the Bishop gang. He threatens her at gunpoint and – despite Jane protesting that she ""hasn't seen Hammond in years"" – he demands that she take him back to her house, as he is convinced that Ham is there, having recognized the gun Jane is carrying as one belonging to Hammond. However, at this point Dan Frost suddenly appears and tells the thug to leave Jane alone. While the two men are distracted, Jane draws her gun and kills the outlaw.
Leaving the body in the alley, Jane and Dan ride back to her house. Ham is still alive, but very weak. Dan has changed his mind about helping Jane, so they start preparing for the expected attack from the Bishop gang.
Meanwhile, Bishop has already set out with his gang to find Ham. His men spread out over the area to extend their search, and one of them chances upon Jane's house. He recognizes Jane, but Dan kills him before he can raise the alarm.
Dan digs a shallow trench in Jane's front yard, and they fill this with jars containing kerosene, nails and pieces of glass. As they work, we see flashbacks of their previous lives. Jane and Dan were once engaged, but he enlisted in the army to fight in the American Civil War. Captured by the enemy, he was held for years in a prison camp, and when he finally returned home, Jane had left. He travelled from state to state trying to find her, showing her photograph in every town. Eventually, he heard that she had moved west on a wagon train led by John Bishop. Dan talked to Bishop, who told him that during the journey Ham and Jane ran off together. He said he would gladly help Dan to track them down, as he had his own scores to settle with Ham, but Dan refused, saying that he preferred to ride alone.
Dan eventually found Jane, but by then she was married to Ham, and they had had a child. Dan realized that he had lost her forever and was left broken-hearted by the discovery.
Later, Jane tells Dan her side of the story. After Dan left to enlist, she discovered she was pregnant. When Dan did not return, or write, she assumed he was dead. By the time their child, a little girl called Mary, was two or three years old, life in Jane's war-torn town had become so wretched that she decided to take Mary and move West on the Bishop wagon train. Too late, she and the other women on the wagon train realized that Bishop's intention was to start a brothel in another town, and he intended to force the helpless women into prostitution.
A further flashback shows that Ham, having taken a fancy to Jane during the wagon train journey, tells Bishop that he would like to marry her. But Bishop tells Ham that Jane is his ""property"". Later, Ham finds that Jane and her daughter have gone missing; searching for Mary, he sees a child's boot in the river, and thinks the child has drowned. He goes to the brothel where Jane has been forced to work, and rescues her. Jane is distraught when Ham tells her that Mary is dead.
Back in the present time, the Bishop gang finally arrive at Jane's house, under cover of darkness. Dan and Jane fire into the booby-trapped ditch, igniting the kerosene ""bombs"". Most of the gang are killed, but some – including Bishop himself – escape. Jane and Dan manage to move the dying Ham into a shallow storage space beneath the floor, to protect him from the gunfire, but the strain is too much for him and he dies. Dan and Jane continue to fight it out with the remaining gang members, although both are wounded. Finally, Bishop (the only gang member left alive) manages to corner Dan and is about to kill him, when Jane sneaks up behind Bishop and draws her gun on him. Trying to persuade her not to kill him, Bishop tells Jane that Mary is not dead, as she had thought. Jane shoots him several times, wounding him badly, until in his agony he reveals that Mary lives at the brothel. Jane then kills Bishop.
Jane and Dan go to the brothel and find their daughter, Mary, who is working as a servant. Jane takes the bodies of John Bishop and his gang to the sheriff and collects a huge reward. Then she, Dan, Mary and Katie ride off together to start a new life as a family.",action western jane husband bill ham hammond live isolated house year old daughter katie day ham return home bullet wound jane attend injury ham tell bishop boy come gang vicious criminal lead john bishop ham ride realize go need help order defend home family bishop ham injury render helpless jane take daughter place safety woman friend trust ride home neighbor dan frost ask help protect property bishop boy dan somewhat surly man live squalid dirty house refuse help obvious brief conversation past history bitterness dan jane jane ride town buy gun ammunition hopefully find help family leave gun shop waylay drag alley bishop gang threaten gunpoint despite jane protest see hammond year demand house convince ham having recognize gun jane carry belong hammond point dan frost suddenly appear tell thug leave jane man distract jane draw gun kill outlaw leave body alley jane dan ride house ham alive weak dan change mind help jane start prepare expect attack bishop gang bishop set gang find ham man spread area extend search chance jane house recognize jane dan kill raise alarm dan dig shallow trench jane yard fill jar contain kerosene nail piece glass work flashback previous life jane dan engage enlist army fight american civil war capture enemy hold year prison camp finally return home jane leave travel state state try find show photograph town eventually hear move west wagon train lead john bishop dan talk bishop tell journey ham jane run say gladly help dan track score settle ham dan refuse say prefer ride dan eventually find jane married ham child dan realize lose forever leave break hearted discovery later jane tell dan story dan leave enlist discover pregnant dan return write assume dead time child little girl call mary year old life jane war tear town wretched decide mary west bishop wagon train late woman wagon train realize bishop intention start brothel town intend force helpless woman prostitution flashback show ham having take fancy jane wagon train journey tell bishop like marry bishop tell ham jane property later ham find jane daughter go missing search mary see child boot river think child drown go brothel jane force work rescue jane distraught ham tell mary dead present time bishop gang finally arrive jane house cover darkness dan jane fire booby trap ditch ignite kerosene bomb gang kill include bishop escape jane dan manage die ham shallow storage space beneath floor protect gunfire strain die dan jane continue fight remain gang member wound finally bishop gang member leave alive manage corner dan kill jane sneak bishop draw gun try persuade kill bishop tell jane mary dead think jane shoot time wound badly agony reveal mary live brothel jane kill bishop jane dan brothel find daughter mary work servant jane take body john bishop gang sheriff collect huge reward dan mary katie ride start new life family
Lan Kwai Fong 3,drama / erotic,"The story follows four women who hit the Hong Kong night-life district of Lan Kwai Fong, looking for excitement and love. Jeana (from the first movie) is now a model in an open, non-committed relationship with Jacky (also from the first movie), and continues with her party-hard night lifestyle. Her friend Sara, feeling neglected by her fiance, looks for excitement by hitting the clubs again. Papa is an ugly duckling who works as an infants' school teacher by day and rushes home to go clubbing at night, hoping to find a guy who will love her. Jolie is a rich orphan who is looking to have fun, having just come back from England during her university holidays.
Jeana and Papa take Sara out to the hottest club at Lan Kwai Fong, Club Magnum, to help her forget about her boyfriend Shin, who would rather hang out with his ex-girlfriend then celebrate his birthday with her. At Club Magnum they meet up with Jeana's boyfriend Jacky, who has managed Club Magnum since Ah Gong's club went out of business. Jacky introduces them to May, the owner of the club, who then introduces them to her partying younger cousin Jolie. Jolie immediately reminds Jacky of his ex-girlfriend Mavis, about whom he still feels guilty. May, knowing Jolie likes to party hard, gives Jacky the task of looking after Jolie. She hopes the two can start a relationship, since his current girlfriend Jeana will soon be leaving for Taiwan for work. Jacky hesitantly agrees to babysit Jolie only because she reminds him of Mavis.
Meanwhile, Jeana pushes Sara to forget about her boyfriend Shin by telling her to party harder and introduces her to her Korean friend Kim. Sara is instantly attracted to Kim but because she is engaged to Shin she stops the two from going past a platonic friendship. During a yacht party thrown by May, Jeana, knowing of the rough patch in Sara and Shin's relationship, tries to seduce Shin and suggest Sara, Jolie and she go on a get away to Seoul, South Korea, to have fun with Kim. On the day they are to depart to Seoul Jeana backs out of the trip with only Sara and Jolie going. While Sara is in Korea, Jeana uses images of Sara having fun with Kim to coax Shin into having sex with her. Coincidentally, while in Korea, Kim is able to convince Sara to give in to her sexual desires and have sex with him. With Kim and Sara leaving Jolie behind at the club, Jolie gets gang raped by two Korean men she just met. At the police station to find out what happened to Jolie, Sara finds out Kim has a wife and was only using her for a no strings attached fling.
Papa, who has the body but not the face, is often called pork chop (ugly girl) by all the men at the club. Being ignored by guys, she sits by herself cutting paper patterns while waiting for a guy too drunk to notice her looks to come along and have a one-night stand with her. She is introduced to one of Shin's friends, Parker, who takes an interest in her. The two eventually have sex one night, with Papa leaving early in the morning thinking Parker will think of it as a one-night stand the next day. Parker waits outside Papa's workplace the next day to tell her he is truly serious about their relationship.
May sends Jacky to Korea to take care of Jolie until she recovers from her horrific incident. In Korea Jolie tells Jacky she knows that she reminds him of his ex-girlfriend Mavis and that he's not obliged to take care of her. Once back in Hong Kong Jacky shows Jolie that he wants to take care of her, not because he has to but because he wants to.

The Beast with Five Fingers,horror,"Francis Ingram (Victor Francen) is a noted pianist who lives in a large manor house near a small, isolated Italian village. Ingram suffered a stroke which left his right side immobile, and he has to use a wheelchair to get around. He has retreated to the manor house for the past few years—seen by only a few close friends. These include his nurse, Julie Holden (Andrea King); a musicologist (and amateur astrologist), Hillary Cummins (Peter Lorre); a friend, Bruce Conrad (Robert Alda); and his sister's son, Donald Arlington (John Alvin). Ingram has fallen in love with Julie Holden, and has changed his will so that she receives the vast bulk of his enormous estate when he dies. But Julie is secretly in love with Conrad. The change in the will disinherits Arlington and Cummins, and Cummins tries to expose Holden's affair. Ingram, outraged at the slander on his beloved's good name, tries to choke Cummins to death. Only Julie's arrival (after meeting Conrad in the garden) saves him.
Later that night, Ingram begins to suffer hallucinations from poison put in his food and drink. He climbs into his wheelchair, makes it to the top of the stairs, and calls out for Julie (who never comes to his aid). Ingram falls down the stairs, breaking his neck. (The audience does not see if Ingram was pushed or he fell.) Commissario Ovidio Castanio (J. Carrol Naish) of the local police investigates the death, but finds little sign of murder.
A few days later, Raymond Arlington (Charles Dingle) (Donald's father) arrives, determined to ensure that his son gets the inheritance. Duprex (David Hoffman), Ingram's attorney, tells Raymond that there are suspicions regarding Ingram's death that may lead to overturning the new will in favor of the old one. That night, Duprex is murdered by an unseen assailant. Commissario Castanio begins to investigate. The Arlingtons try to search for the old will, while suspicion falls on Cummins after he tries to remove several expensive old books from the manor house. That night, everyone hears Ingram playing the piano in the main hall, but when they go to check no one is there. Donald, too, is attacked and almost choked to death. Commissario Castanio discovers that someone has broken into the Ingram mausoleum and cut off Ingram's left hand. But it seems impossible for anyone to have gotten in or out.
The audience now begins to see a disembodied hand moving around the manor house. The hand attacks Cummins, but he is able to assuage the hand's quest for vengeance by giving the hand Ingram's signet ring. He locks the hand in a closet, but when Conrad and Holden appear to see what has happened — the hand has disappeared. Meanwhile, Donald Arlington remembers the combination and location of an old safe in the house, and Commissario Castanio and his father accompany him to the room where it is located. They discover the old will...and the disembodied hand. In a fit of madness, Donald Arlington flees the house with Conrad in pursuit. He comes to his senses, and is not harmed. When Holden claims to have discovered the hand, Cummins (becoming more and more mentally unhinged) tries to burn it in the fire. But the hand crawls out and chokes him to death.
Commissario Castanio discovers a hidden record player and concludes that Cummins was playing it to scare people. He theorizes that Cummins cut off the hand, killed Duprex, and tried to kill Arlington. By which point, his mind had snapped, making him believe his own fabricated plot.",horror francis ingram victor francen noted pianist live large manor house near small isolated italian village ingram suffer stroke leave right immobile use wheelchair retreat manor house past year see close friend include nurse julie holden andrea king musicologist amateur astrologist hillary cummin peter lorre friend bruce conrad robert alda sister son donald arlington john alvin ingram fall love julie holden change receive vast bulk enormous estate die julie secretly love conrad change disinherit arlington cummin cummin try expose holden affair ingram outrage slander beloved good try choke cummin death julie arrival meet conrad garden save later night ingram begin suffer hallucination poison food drink climb wheelchair make stair call julie come aid ingram fall stair break neck audience ingram push fall commissario ovidio castanio carrol naish local police investigate death find little sign murder day later raymond arlington charles dingle donald father arrive determine ensure son get inheritance duprex david hoffman ingram attorney tell raymond suspicion ingram death lead overturn new favor old night duprex murder unseen assailant commissario castanio begin investigate arlington try search old suspicion fall cummin try remove expensive old book manor house night hear ingram play piano main hall check donald attack choke death commissario castanio discover break ingram mausoleum cut ingram left hand impossible get audience begin disembody hand move manor house hand attack cummin able assuage hand quest vengeance give hand ingram signet ring lock hand closet conrad holden appear happen hand disappear donald arlington remember combination location old safe house commissario castanio father accompany room locate discover old disembodied hand fit madness donald arlington flee house conrad pursuit come sense harm holden claim discover hand cummin mentally unhinged try burn fire hand crawl choke death commissario castanio discover hidden record player conclude cummin play scare people theorize cummin cut hand kill duprex try kill arlington point mind snap make believe fabricated plot

Jumbo,animation ,"The movie starts with Akshay Kumar singing the song ""Everything's Gonna Be All Right"" for the children in the school. He then begins talking to one child who seems to be depressed. He then narrates the story of Jumbo to this child.
Jumbo is a small blue elephant (voiced by Akshay Kumar) who grows up with his mother (voiced by Dimple Kapadia). His mother never reveals any details of his father and neither do the rest of the elephants in the herd. He is a happy go lucky elephant, who loves to play with the other animals of the jungle. Occasionally he would be confronted by the other elephants of the herd, who would bully him on the history of his father. Tired of being teased about his father's cowardice in some war, he confronts his mom again who somehow manages to rubbish the topic. One night he comes to know that a large army has come to the jungle, and they plan an overnight stay. In the hope of finding his father, Jumbo sets out to the camp, and manages to locate a tent that houses the royal elephant of that army. He goes in and politely asks the royal elephant about his father. All of a sudden the royal elephant turns very violent and Jumbo starts running for cover. In the meanwhile the soldiers standing outside see Jumbo running out of the tent and try to capture it. Jumbo manages to go into the tent of prince Vikramaditya. Vikramaditya then saves Jumbo from the soldiers. It is then revealed that Vikramaditya is the prince of a captured kingdom and is a POW. After running away from the camp Jumbo realizes that he is separated from his mother and is lost in the jungle. He wanders in the jungle for a while where he meets Sonia (voiced by Lara Dutta) a cute pink elephant. He meets some villagers and a wise old Mahout who is the guardian of Sonia. They teach him the art of war and also make him strong and confident. He grows up to be a well built and strong war elephant.
Prince Vikramaditya then calls for his whole kingdom to unite and fight against the oppressive rule of the enemy. Jumbo and his Mahout then go for a competition called by Vikramaditya, for the selection of the royal elephant. Jumbo finds his mother at Vikramaditya's court and she finally tells him the story of his father who was a war elephant and never returned after a war. They sneak into a tent which houses the ex-royal elephants, hoping to locate Jumbo's father. There they meet an old royal elephant who knows Jumbo's father. He then narrates what happened in the battle. He tells them that Jumbo's father was killed by Bakhtavar, the enemy's royal elephant, after a fierce battle.
Jumbo then set out with king Vikramaditya to avenge the death of his father. Jumbo shows the same strength and skill which his father possessed in his days. They challenge Bakhtavar for a one-on-one combat. Then follows a fierce battle between Jumbo and Bakhtavar, in which Jumbo kills Bakhtavar in the same manner that his father was killed. In the end Akshay, who is narrating the story to a small kid, again emphasises his words ""everything's gonna be all right, chalteh hai side by side"".",animation movie start akshay kumar singe song go to right child school begin talk child depressed narrate story jumbo child jumbo small blue elephant voice akshay kumar grow mother voice dimple kapadia mother reveal detail father rest elephant herd happy lucky elephant love play animal jungle occasionally confront elephant herd bully history father tired tease father cowardice war confront mom manage rubbish topic night come know large army come jungle plan overnight stay hope find father jumbo set camp manage locate tent house royal elephant army go politely ask royal elephant father sudden royal elephant turn violent jumbo start run cover soldier stand outside jumbo run tent try capture jumbo manage tent prince vikramaditya vikramaditya save jumbo soldier reveal vikramaditya prince capture kingdom pow run away camp jumbo realize separate mother lose jungle wander jungle meet sonia voice lara dutta cute pink elephant meet villager wise old mahout guardian sonia teach art war strong confident grow build strong war elephant prince vikramaditya call kingdom unite fight oppressive rule enemy jumbo mahout competition call vikramaditya selection royal elephant jumbo find mother vikramaditya court finally tell story father war elephant return war sneak tent house ex royal elephant hope locate jumbo father meet old royal elephant know jumbo father narrate happen battle tell jumbo father kill bakhtavar enemy royal elephant fierce battle jumbo set king vikramaditya avenge death father jumbo show strength skill father possess day challenge bakhtavar combat follow fierce battle jumbo bakhtavar jumbo kill bakhtavar manner father kill end akshay narrate story small kid emphasise word go to right chalteh hai

The Mechanic,action,"Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson) is a ""mechanic""—a top hit man (assassin). He works exclusively for a secret international organization, which has very strict rules. Bishop is very sophisticated, as he regularly listens to classical music, has an art collection, and is a connoisseur of fine wines. However, he is forced to live alone - he cannot show emotions or trust people. Bishop is under constant emotional pressure, so much so that he is prescribed medication for depression, and one day he is temporarily hospitalized when he loses consciousness as a result of the stress. Bishop pays a call girl (Jill Ireland to have a simulated romantic (social and sexual) relationship, including her writing him fake love letters.
When Bishop is assigned one of the organization's heads, ""Big Harry"" McKenna (Keenan Wynn), he shoots at Big Harry, while making him think that the shots are being fired by a hidden sniper. Harry, who Bishop knows has a weak heart, runs up a steep incline, which triggers a heart attack. Bishop then finishes Harry off by smothering him.
At Big Harry's funeral, Bishop again runs into Harry's narcissistic, ruthless and ambitious son Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent). Steve is intrigued by Bishop and seeks to find out more about him. Bishop is also intrigued, as he realizes that Steve has a personality suited for being a hit man, and plays along. As part of his training, Bishop teaches Steve that ""every person has a weakness, and that once this weakness is found, the target is easy to kill."" But Bishop failed to get his superiors' prior consent for the arrangement. Following a messy assassination conducted by Bishop and Steve, the organization warns Bishop that his irresponsible choice to involve Steve has been interpreted as selfish behavior.
The organization then gives Bishop an urgent mission, this time in Italy. Once again, Bishop involves Steve in the new plan, but just before they leave Bishop happens to find among Steve's belongings a file containing a lot of information about Bishop. This file is very similar to the files Bishop prepared for his targets. Nevertheless, Bishop allows Steve to go with him to Italy.
In Italy, Bishop and Steve approach a boat where their intended victim is supposed to be, but it becomes apparent that this was a trap and they are the real targets. Bishop and Steve are ambushed, but they manage to kill all their would-be assassins.
His apprenticeship apparently complete, Steve shares a celebratory bottle of wine with Bishop, having coated the latter's glass with brucine, a colorless and deadly alkaloid. When Bishop realizes that he has been poisoned, he asks Steve if it was because Bishop had killed Steve's father. Steve responds that he had not realized his father was murdered. Steve taunts Bishop, saying ""you told me that everyone has a jelly spot--yours was that you couldn't cut it alone."" Steve goes on to reveal that he was not acting on orders to kill Bishop.
Steve returns to Bishop's home to pick up the Ford Mustang he had left there. He finds a note affixed to the rear-view mirror, which reads: ""Steve, if you read this it means I didn't make it back. It also means you've broken a filament controlling a 13-second delay trigger. End of game. Bang! You're dead.""

Eega,socio-fantasy,"A young girl who is unable to sleep asks her father to tell her a bedtime story. Although reluctant at first, he tells her a story of a fly named Nani.
Nani is a young man who specialises in preparing fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a micro artist who runs Project 511, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Bindu also develops feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates ₹1.5 million (US$23.03 thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.
The fly's memory is triggered when it encounters Sudeep and Bindu. Sudeep asks the heartbroken Bindu to accompany him to New Delhi to meet the education minister; if she can impress the minister with a presentation about the NGO, he might help it gain national recognition. The fly causes Sudeep to have an accident on his way to the airport and writes ""I will kill you"" on the windshield; this makes Sudeep paranoid. The fly, who sees Bindu mourning Nani's death in her bedroom, reveals itself to be Nani by writing on the desk with her tears. It conveys the circumstances of Nani's death to Bindu, and they join forces against Sudeep. The latter's obsession with the fly affects his professional and personal life. In a chain of events, his money is burnt to ashes, leaving him almost penniless.[c]
Sudeep learns from a sorcerer that Nani is reincarnated as a fly and seeks revenge. Sudeep arranges to kill Nani but the fly escapes and causes a short circuit, killing the sorcerer and leaving Sudeep unconscious. Nani and Bindu assume Sudeep is dead but he is saved by his business partner. Sudeep is enraged when he learns that Bindu is helping the fly. Sudeep kills his partner to collect a ₹7 billion (US$107.49 million) insurance policy.
Sudeep takes Bindu to his home and Nani follows them. Nani seriously injures Sudeep with a needle. The latter clips Nani's wing and fatally stabs him with the same needle. Nani jumps through the flame of a burning match then into a loaded cannon, which fires. The projectile passes through Sudeep and hits an oxygen cylinder, which explodes and kills him.

Happy Birthday to Me,slasher film,"Virginia ""Ginny"" Wainwright is a pretty and popular high school senior at Crawford Academy, a member of the school's ""Top Ten,"" an elite clique of the most privileged and popular students. Each night, the group meets at the Silent Woman Tavern, a local pub. One night en route to the tavern, Bernadette O'Hara is attacked in her car by an unseen assailant. She struggles and plays dead to catch the killer off-guard before running to get help. She then runs into an unseen individual who she is familiar with and begs for help, but he slashes her neck with a straight razor.
The Top Ten becomes concerned when Bernadette fails to arrive at the pub. Upon leaving, the group sees the nearby drawbridge raising and decide to play a game of chicken. Ginny is pushed into a car by Ann Thomason, and each of the group attempt to cross the bridge as it raises; the car Ginny is in barely clears the bridge, crashing as it meets the other side. Distraught, Ginny runs home, stopping at her mother's grave in an adjacent cemetery. At her home, Etienne Vercoures - a French foreign exchange student and a Top Ten member - has broken into Ginny's room and stolen her underwear.
Bernadette fails to show up at school the following day. Ginny, who is plagued by repressed memories, visits her on-call psychiatrist, Dr. Faraday, with whom she previously underwent an experimental brain tissue restoration procedure after surviving a harrowing accident at the drawbridge. As Ginny attempts to resume her normal life, her fellow Top Ten members are murdered in vicious and violent ways: Etienne is strangled when his scarf gets caught in the spokes of his motorcycle, and Greg is crushed in the school gym while lifting weights.
One night, Alfred, a Top Ten member who is infatuated with Ginny, follows her to her mother's grave. In retaliation, she stabs him with a pair of garden shears. On the weekend of Ginny's 18th birthday, her father leaves for a business trip. After a school dance, Ginny invites Steve to her house and prepares shish kebabs. While the two are drinking wine and smoking marijuana, Ginny attacks Steve with the kebab, violently shoving the skewer down his throat.
Ann arrives at Ginny's house the following morning and finds Ginny taking a shower. In the shower, Ginny has a flashback of her mother's death: Her mother, a newly-inducted socialite, invited the Top Ten to Ginny's birthday celebration four years earlier. Instead, the group opted to attend Ann's party. Drunk, her mother drove to the Thomasons' house with Ginny, where she was humiliated by Ann's parents. Enraged, she attempted to drive across the raising drawbridge, resulting in a violent crash which ended in her drowning. Ginny, however, managed to swim to safety.
Paranoid that she may be murdering her friends during blackout episodes, Ginny visits Dr. Faraday. When she confronts him over the procedure she underwent, he is evasive, and she murders him with a fireplace poker. Mr. Wainright returns home for Ginny's birthday and finds a pool of blood in the foyer. He flees, and finds one of Ginny's friends, Amelia, standing in the rain, clutching a wrapped gift. In the cemetery, he discovers his late wife's grave to have been robbed, with Dr. Faraday's corpse lying in it.
Mr. Wainright notices a light on inside the family's guest cottage. Inside, he finds the bodies of each member of the Top Ten seated at a table alongside his dead wife's corpse. Ginny enters the room with a birthday cake, singing ""Happy Birthday"" to herself. Ginny casually admits to the murders before slashing her father's throat. He dies, failing to notice that his actual daughter is seated at the table. His killer, Ann, has disguised herself as Ginny with an elaborate latex mask. Ann removes the mask, ranting and raving over her father's affair with Ginny's mother and how it destroyed her family. Ann reveals that she and Ginny are half-sisters. Ginny manages to wrest the knife from Ann and stabs her to death. As she stands over Ann's corpse holding the bloodied knife, a police officer enters the cottage and pleads: ""What have you done?""",slasher film virginia ginny wainwright pretty popular high school senior crawford academy member school elite clique privileged popular student night group meet silent woman tavern local pub night en route tavern bernadette attack car unseen assailant struggle play dead catch killer guard run help run unseen individual familiar beg help slash neck straight razor concerned bernadette fail arrive pub leave group see nearby drawbridge raising decide play game chicken ginny push car ann thomason group attempt cross bridge raise car ginny barely clear bridge crash meet distraught ginny run home stop mother grave adjacent cemetery home etienne vercoure french foreign exchange student member break ginny room steal underwear bernadette fail school follow day ginny plague repressed memory visit psychiatrist dr faraday previously undergo experimental brain tissue restoration procedure survive harrowing accident drawbridge ginny attempt resume normal life fellow member murder vicious violent way etienne strangle scarf get catch spoke motorcycle greg crush school gym lift weight night alfred member infatuate ginny follow mother grave retaliation stab pair garden shear weekend ginny birthday father leave business trip school dance ginny invite steve house prepare shish kebab drink wine smoking marijuana ginny attack steve kebab violently shove skewer throat ann arrive ginny house follow morning find ginny take shower shower ginny flashback mother death mother newly induct socialite invite ginny birthday celebration year early instead group opt attend ann party drunk mother drive thomason house ginny humiliate ann parent enraged attempt drive raise drawbridge result violent crash end drowning ginny manage swim safety paranoid murder friend blackout episode ginny visit dr faraday confront procedure undergo evasive murder fireplace poker mr wainright return home ginny birthday find pool blood foyer flee find ginny friend amelia stand rain clutch wrap gift cemetery discover late wife grave rob dr faraday corpse lie mr wainright notice light inside family guest cottage inside find body member seat table alongside dead wife corpse ginny enter room birthday cake singe happy birthday ginny casually admit murder slash father throat die fail notice actual daughter seat table killer ann disguise ginny elaborate latex mask ann remove mask rant rave father affair ginny mother destroy family ann reveal ginny half sister ginny manage wrest knife ann stab death stand ann corpse hold bloody knife police officer enter cottage plead
Breakdown,thriller,"Jeff Taylor and his wife Amy drive cross-country from Boston to San Diego in their new Jeep. Jeff narrowly avoids colliding with a beat-up truck. Later, at a gas station, Earl, the truck's driver, confronts Jeff and they exchange hostile words.
Shortly after the couple resume their journey, their car breaks down on a vacant road. Leaving Jeff with the Jeep, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big rig trucker to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that someone has tampered with the Jeep's battery connections. After reconnecting them, he drives to the diner, only to discover that no one has seen Amy. When he sees the trucker on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or Amy. Jeff then hails a passing sheriff named Boyd, but a brief search of the truck yields no sign of Amy. The trucker, Red Barr, is let go and Jeff is instructed by Boyd to see his deputy in the town of Brackett.
After speaking with the deputy, Jeff goes back to the diner. Billy, a mentally-impaired mechanic, informs Jeff that Amy left with some men, but refuses to speak with the police, claiming they are involved. Jeff rushes to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl. He escapes by driving his Jeep into a river, then circles back on foot to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the river. He is then discovered and knocked out by Billy.
When Jeff wakes up, he is confronted by Billy (who feigned mental impairment earlier), Earl, and another accomplice named Al. Their leader is none other than Red Barr, who informs Jeff that he wants the $90,000 in Jeff's bank account and orders him to withdraw the money in the nearby town of Brackett in exchange for Amy's life. Realizing he has only a fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff attempts to alert the bank manager to his plight. However, paranoid that Red's group is keeping an eye on him, Jeff abandons the idea and steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener. He uses the money ribbons to pack stacks of $1 bills between two $100 bills.
Jeff is then instructed to leave town, where Earl picks him up and binds him with duct tape. Earl begins gloating about how Jeff and his wife were easy targets, how he tampered with their Jeep and that his group intends to kill them anyway. Jeff cuts himself free with the letter opener and stabs Earl. After a brief struggle, Jeff takes over the vehicle, binds Earl, and tortures him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. They pass Boyd, who sees the speeding, swerving pickup and stops the vehicle. When Jeff exits the truck with Earl's gun, Boyd mistakes the situation and forces him to lie down. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with a concealed gun. Before Earl can shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills him. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and rushes to the truck stop.
At the stop, Jeff sees Red and stows away under his truck. Early the next morning, Red arrives at his farm. Jeff sneaks into the barn, discovering evidence that Red has a history robbing and killing people and that his real name is Warren. Al and Billy arrive with a bound and gagged Amy, and the three lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the cellar door, Jeff finds a gun and demands the cellar key from Red. When he is distracted by Red's son, Billy escapes. Jeff forces Al, Red, his wife, and his son to release Amy, then locks them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy steal a pickup and flee, while Billy returns to free Red and Al, who each pursue the Taylors in their own vehicles.
During the pursuit, Billy is killed when Jeff forces his car off the road. Shortly after, the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to force Jeff and Amy's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Jeff rushes out of the vehicle and into Red's big rig, where a struggle over the steering wheel forces Red's truck over the edge, leaving it dangling on a steel bridge support. Jeff fights Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling him to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard. Seeing that Red survived the fall, Amy pulls the automatic shifter on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.",thriller jeff taylor wife amy drive cross country boston san diego new jeep jeff narrowly avoid collide beat truck later gas station earl truck driver confront jeff exchange hostile word shortly couple resume journey car break vacant road leave jeff jeep amy accept ride pass big rig trucker nearby diner help jeff eventually discover tamper jeep battery connection reconnecte drive diner discover see amy see trucker road force stop trucker claim see jeff amy jeff hail pass sheriff name boyd brief search truck yield sign amy trucker red barr let jeff instruct boyd deputy town brackett speak deputy jeff go diner billy mentally impair mechanic inform jeff amy leave man refuse speak police claim involve jeff rush location billy mention ambush road earl escape drive jeep river circle foot watch attacker salvage jeep river discover knock billy jeff wake confront billy feign mental impairment early earl accomplice name al leader red barr inform jeff want jeff bank account order withdraw money nearby town brackett exchange amy life realize fraction assumed jeff attempt alert bank manager plight paranoid red group keep eye jeff abandon idea steal mark money ribbon letter opener use money ribbon pack stack bill bill jeff instruct leave town earl pick bind duct tape earl begin gloat jeff wife easy target tamper jeep group intend kill jeff cut free letter opener stab earl brief struggle jeff take vehicle bind earl torture reveal rendezvous red local truck stop pass boyd see speeding swerve pickup stop vehicle jeff exit truck earl gun boyd mistake situation force lie earl free shoot boyd conceal gun earl shoot jeff wound boyd shoot kill jeff use boyd radio ambulance rush truck stop stop jeff see red stow away truck early morning red arrive farm jeff sneak barn discover evidence red history rob kill people real warren al billy arrive bound gag amy lock freezer barn cellar leave die unable open cellar door jeff find gun demand cellar key red distract red son billy escape jeff forces al red wife son release amy lock cellar jeff amy steal pickup flee billy return free red al pursue taylor vehicle pursuit billy kill jeff force car road shortly trailer red truck detache cause al violently crash undeterred red attempt force jeff amy vehicle bridge trap amy leg underneath dashboard jeff rush vehicle red big rig struggle steering wheel force red truck edge leave dangle steel bridge support jeff fight red suspend big rig eventually hurl rock jeff free amy dashboard see red survive fall amy pull automatic shifter pickup cause semi fall red crush sit edge bridge mangle pickup jeff amy embrace
The Warriors,action,"Cyrus, leader of the Gramercy Riffs, the most powerful gang in New York City, calls a midnight summit of all the city's gangs, requesting them to send nine unarmed delegates to Van Cortlandt Park. The Warriors, from Coney Island, attend the summit. Cyrus proposes to the assembled crowd a permanent citywide truce and alliance that would allow the gangs to control the city since they outnumber the police by five to one. Most of the gangs applaud his idea, but Luther, leader of the Rogues, shoots Cyrus dead. In the resulting chaos, Luther frames the Warriors' leader Cleon for the murder, and Cleon is beaten down and most likely killed by the Riffs. Meanwhile, the other Warriors have escaped, unaware that they've been implicated in Cyrus' murder. The Riffs put out a hit on the Warriors through a radio DJ. Swan, the Warriors' ""war chief"", takes charge of the group as they try to make it back home.
Almost immediately the Warriors are spotted by the Turnbull ACs who attempt to run them down with their bus, but the Warriors manage to escape and board the subway. On the ride to Coney Island, the train is stopped by a fire on the tracks, stranding the Warriors in Tremont, in the Bronx. Setting out on foot, they come across a group called the Orphans who were not invited to Cyrus' meeting and who are insecure and belligerent about their low status in the city gang hierarchy. Swan makes peace with the Orphans' leader, Sully, who agrees to let the Warriors pass through their territory unharmed. However, a young woman named Mercy mocks Sully as a ""chicken"" and instigates a confrontation. Mercy's goading convinces Sully to demand that the Warriors take off their colors and go as civilians before walking through their neighborhood. Swan and the Warriors flatly refuse Sully's demand, and the Orphans challenge them to a fight. Outnumbered and unarmed, Swan and the Warriors throw a Molotov cocktail at a car, blowing it up and using the opportunity to escape to the train station. Impressed, and desperate to escape her depressed neighborhood, Mercy follows the Warriors.
When they arrive at the 96th Street and Broadway station in Manhattan, they are chased by police and separated. Three of them, Vermin, Cochise, and Rembrandt, make the train to Union Square, while Fox, struggling with a police officer, falls onto the tracks and is run over by a train as Mercy escapes. Swan and the remaining three Warriors, Ajax, Snow, and Cowboy, are chased by the Baseball Furies into Riverside Park, where a brawl ensues in which the Warriors easily defeat the Baseball Furies. After the fight, Ajax notices a lone woman in the park, becomes sexually aggressive and is arrested when the woman turns out to be an undercover police officer. Arriving at Union Square, Vermin, Cochise, and Rembrandt are seduced by an all-female gang called the Lizzies and invited into their hideout. The trio manages to escape the Lizzies' subsequent attack, learning in the process that everyone believes they murdered Cyrus.
Having scouted ahead on his own, Swan returns to the 96th Street station and finds Mercy there. More police show up and Swan and Mercy flee into the tunnel. They have an argument and Swan continues to Union Square where he reunites with the other Warriors. A fistfight ensues with the Punks in a public restroom which the Warriors win. Meanwhile, the Riffs are visited by a gang member who attended the earlier gathering and saw Luther shoot Cyrus.
The Warriors finally arrive at Coney Island at dawn, only to find the Rogues are waiting for them. During the confrontation, Swan says ""When we see the ocean, we figure we're home."" When Swan asks why Luther shot Cyrus, Luther says it was for ""no reason"" and ""I like doing things like that."" Swan then challenges Luther to a one-on-one fight, but the Rogue leader pulls his gun instead. Swan throws a knife into Luther's wrist, disarming him. The Riffs then arrive in force and apprehend the Rogues, but not before acknowledging the Warriors' courage and skill. As the Warriors leave, Luther screams in anguish as the entire Riffs gang descends upon the Rogues.
The radio DJ then announces that the big alert has been called off and salutes the Warriors with a song, ""In the City"". Swan, Mercy, and the rest of the gang walk down the beach, illuminated by the rising sun.",action cyrus leader gramercy riff powerful gang new york city call midnight summit city gang request send unarmed delegate van cortlandt park warrior coney island attend summit cyrus propose assemble crowd permanent citywide truce alliance allow gang control city outnumber police gang applaud idea luther leader rogue shoot cyrus dead result chaos luther frame warrior leader cleon murder cleon beat likely kill riff warrior escape unaware implicate cyrus murder riff hit warrior radio dj swan warrior war chief take charge group try home immediately warrior spot turnbull acs attempt run bus warrior manage escape board subway ride coney island train stop fire track strand warrior tremont bronx set foot come group call orphan invite cyrus meeting insecure belligerent low status city gang hierarchy swan make peace orphan leader sully agree let warrior pass territory unharmed young woman name mercy mock sully chicken instigate confrontation mercy goad convince sully demand warrior color civilian walk neighborhood swan warrior flatly refuse sully demand orphan challenge fight outnumber unarmed swan warrior throw molotov cocktail car blow opportunity escape train station impressed desperate escape depressed neighborhood mercy follow warrior arrive street broadway station manhattan chase police separate vermin cochise rembrandt train union square fox struggle police officer fall track run train mercy escape swan remain warrior ajax snow cowboy chase baseball fury riverside park brawl ensue warrior easily defeat baseball fury fight ajax notice lone woman park sexually aggressive arrest woman turn undercover police officer arrive union square vermin cochise rembrandt seduce female gang call lizzie invite hideout trio manage escape lizzie subsequent attack learn process believe murder cyrus having scout ahead swan return street station find mercy police swan mercy flee tunnel argument swan continue union square reunite warrior fistfight ensue punk public restroom warrior win riff visit gang member attend early gathering see luther shoot cyrus warrior finally arrive coney island dawn find rogue wait confrontation swan say ocean figure home swan ask luther shot cyrus luther say reason like thing like swan challenge luther fight rogue leader pull gun instead swan throw knife luther wrist disarm riff arrive force apprehend rogue acknowledge warrior courage skill warrior leave luther scream anguish entire riff gang descend rogue radio dj announce big alert call salute warrior song city swan mercy rest gang walk beach illuminate rise sun

Planet of Dinosaurs,sci-fi,"After a mechanical failure aboard the spaceship Odyssey, Captain Lee Norsythe (Louie Lawless) is forced to crash land on a planet with atmosphere and conditions much like that of Earth, although it is many light-years away. As the ship sinks into the lake that it landed in, communications officer Cindy (Mary Appleseth) realizes that she forgot the radio in the ship and attempts to retrieve it, with the assistance of fellow crew-member Chuck (Chuck Pennington). En route, Cindy is attacked and killed by an unidentified aquatic creature, prompting Chuck to return to shore without the radio.
Realizing that they are stranded, the remaining eight people aboard the ship decide that survival is their primary goal and begin to explore the planet that they have landed on. Derna Lee (Derna Wylde) slips while going through a swamp, dropping the laser gun that Mike (Max Thayer) had given her in the water and rendering the gun unusable. They eventually come across a Brontosaurus, which leads them to deduce that the planet is following a similar evolutionary track as Earth, but is millions of years younger. Later, Charlotte (Charlotte Speer) determines that the plant life, especially the berries, is poisonous. After another dinosaur encounter, Lee decides that the best option is to climb the mountains and reach a higher plateau, where he believes the large creatures will be unable to reach them.
During the ascent, Nyla (Pamela Bottaro) slips and loses the entire supply of food rations, which Lee refuses to retrieve. Near a cave higher up the mountain, Vice-President of Spaceways Incorporated Harvey Baylor (Harvey Shain) discovers a nest full of eggs. After stealing an egg, Harvey is attacked and killed by a Centrosaurus. Soon after, much to ship engineer Jim's (James Whitworth) dismay, Lee decides to halt the expedition and settle at what he considers to be a defensible area. Lee expects to hold out until they are rescued, but Jim believes them to be trapped forever on the planet, and advises that they begin a new civilization. Lee triumphs and the remaining crew begin to build a defensive stockade around a cave. After several more encounters, a large Tyrannosaurus arrives and kills Derna, demolishing the stockade in the process.
The crew finally agrees with Jim that the best way to survive is to kill the predator. Their first plan, devised by Lee, is to attempt to poison the dinosaur by smearing berries on a dead Polacanthus and leave it outside of the Tyrannosaurus's lair. The plan backfires when the beast attacks from behind, killing Mike. Jim's plan is to set up large, wooden stakes and coat them in the poison, then lure the predator into them to be impaled. After some initial troubles the plan works, killing the Tyrannosaurus. Years pass and the survivors have set up an agricultural settlement. Chuck and Charlotte now have a son. Charlotte wonders if they will ever be rescued, to which Nyla comments that it does not seem important anymore.",sci fi mechanical failure aboard spaceship odyssey captain lee norsythe louie lawless force crash land planet atmosphere condition like earth light year away ship sink lake land communication officer cindy mary appleseth realize forget radio ship attempt retrieve assistance fellow crew member chuck chuck pennington en route cindy attack kill unidentified aquatic creature prompt chuck return shore radio realize strand remain people aboard ship decide survival primary goal begin explore planet land derna lee derna wylde slip go swamp drop laser gun mike max thayer give water render gun unusable eventually come brontosaurus lead deduce planet follow similar evolutionary track earth million year young later charlotte charlotte speer determine plant life especially berry poisonous dinosaur encounter lee decide good option climb mountain reach high plateau believe large creature unable reach ascent nyla pamela bottaro slip lose entire supply food ration lee refuse retrieve near cave high mountain vice president spaceways incorporate harvey baylor harvey shain discover nest egg steal egg harvey attack kill centrosaurus soon ship engineer jim james whitworth dismay lee decide halt expedition settle consider defensible area lee expect hold rescue jim believe trap forever planet advise begin new civilization lee triumph remain crew begin build defensive stockade cave encounter large tyrannosaurus arrive kill derna demolish stockade process crew finally agree jim good way survive kill predator plan devise lee attempt poison dinosaur smear berry dead polacanthu leave outside tyrannosaurus lair plan backfire beast attack kill mike jim plan set large wooden stake coat poison lure predator impale initial trouble plan work kill tyrannosaurus year pass survivor set agricultural settlement chuck charlotte son charlotte wonder rescue nyla comment important anymore

Life,comedy,"Elderly inmate Willie Long (Obba Babatundé) attends the burial of two friends who recently perished in an infirmary fire in a Mississippi prison. He begins telling the two young inmates digging the graves his friends' life story.
Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy) and Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) are two New Yorkers in 1932 from two different worlds. Ray is a small-time hustler and petty thief, and Claude, an honest, yet often selfish minded man, has just been accepted for a job as a bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. They are both at a club called Spanky's when Ray picks Claude as his mark to pick-pocket. They both end up in the bad graces of the club's owner Spanky (Rick James), and Ray arranges for himself and Claude to do some boot-legging to pay off their debt, heading down south in order to buy a carload of Mississippi 'hooch'. Before they can get back to New York, a man named Winston Hancock (Clarence Williams III), who swindled Ray in a card game, is murdered outside of a juke joint by the town's sheriff, Warren Pike (Ned Vaughn), who frames Ray and Claude for the murder. A short time later, they go to trial, are convicted, and sentenced to life.
Ray and Claude are sent to an infamous prison camp called 'Camp 8' (now Mississippi State Penitentiary) to perform hard labor. They spend the next 65 years trying to escape from prison, while making new friends - Biscuit (Miguel A. Núñez Jr.), Jangle Leg (Bernie Mac), Radio (Guy Torry), Goldmouth (Michael Taliferro), Cookie (Anthony Anderson) and Pokerface (Barry Shabaka Henley) - and dodging guards Sergeant Dillard (Nick Cassavetes) and Hoppin' Bob (Brent Jennings) as their own friendship grows. Claude has his attorney cousin, Melvin, appeal against his conviction with his girlfriend Daisy's help, but it is denied, and shortly afterwards he finds out that Daisy has left him for Melvin. With any chance of being freed gone, Claude attempts to escape one night with Ray, getting as far as Tallahatchie before being captured and sentenced to a week in solitary confinement.
Around 1944, 12 years later, aged 37 years old, they meet a mute inmate nicknamed 'Can't-Get-Right' (Bokeem Woodbine), a talented baseball player. He catches the eye of a Negro League scout who states that he can get him out of prison if he will play baseball. Ray and Claude, seeing an opportunity to freedom, try to convince the scout to help let them out as well, as they relate to 'Can't-Get-Right' and get him to play best. During a dance social, Biscuit confides to Ray that he is going to be released; however, Biscuit is afraid to return to his family, being gay, and committs suicide by deliberately running across the ""firing line"", getting shot and killed by the guard. After 'Can't-Get-Right' is released to play for the Pittsburgh Crawfords, Ray devises an escape but Claude refuses, upset with the fact that 'Can't-Get-Right' was released without them, leading to an argument that results in Ray and Claude going their separate ways.
Twenty-eight years later, in 1972, Ray and Claude are now elderly, aged 65 years old. All of the duo's friends are gone either by death or release from prison, except for Willie, now confined to a wheelchair. Dillard still runs the camp, who one day informs Ray and Claude that they will be transferred to live and work at Superintendent Dexter Wilkins' (Ned Beatty) mansion. Claude forms a friendship with Wilkins, and is entrusted to drive and pick up the new superintendent, Sheriff Warren Pike (R. Lee Ermey), the man who framed them forty years earlier. While on a pheasant hunt, Ray confronts Pike, where the sheriff admits to framing him and Claude with no remorse saying that ""The state of Mississippi got forty years of cheap labor out of the deal."" As Claude struggles to stop Ray from taking revenge, Pike attempts to kill them both, but he is shot and killed by Wilkins, realizing that Ray and Claude are indeed innocent, covering it up as a hunting accident. He intends to give them a pardon, but dies of a heart attack before he can do so.
In 1997 (present day), Ray and Claude are now very elderly, aged 90 years, living in the prison's infirmary. Claude tells Ray of yet another plan he has devised, but Ray has accepted his fate of dying in prison. That night, the infirmary catches fire, and they seemingly perish in the flames. Willie concludes the tale by outlining Claude’s plan: Ray and Claude would steal two bodies from the morgue, start the blaze, plant the bodies, hide in the fire trucks and depart with them in the morning. When the workers ask why the plan didn't work, Willie tells them that he ""never said it didn't work"", as the inmates begin to realize that the bodies they buried are not Ray and Claude, who have escaped back to New York, watching a New York Yankees baseball game. The film concludes by revealing the two are again on good terms, living together in Harlem.",comedy elderly inmate willie long obba babatundé attend burial friend recently perish infirmary fire mississippi prison begin tell young inmate dig grave friend life story ray gibson eddie murphy claude bank martin lawrence new yorker different world ray small time hustler petty thief claude honest selfish minded man accept job bank teller federal manhattan club call spanky ray pick claude mark pick pocket end bad grace club owner spanky rick james ray arrange claude boot legging pay debt head south order buy carload mississippi hooch new york man name winston hancock clarence williams iii swindle ray card game murder outside juke joint town sheriff warren pike ned vaughn frame ray claude murder short time later trial convict sentence life ray claude send infamous prison camp call camp mississippi state penitentiary perform hard labor spend year try escape prison make new friend biscuit miguel núñez jr jangle leg bernie mac radio guy torry goldmouth michael taliferro cookie anthony anderson pokerface barry shabaka henley dodge guard sergeant dillard nick cassavete hoppin bob brent jenning friendship grow claude attorney cousin melvin appeal conviction girlfriend daisy help deny shortly find daisy leave melvin chance free gone claude attempt escape night ray get far tallahatchie capture sentence week solitary confinement year later age year old meet mute inmate nickname right bokeem woodbine talented baseball player catch eye negro league scout state prison play baseball ray claude see opportunity freedom try convince scout help let relate right play well dance social biscuit confide ray go release biscuit afraid return family gay committs suicide deliberately run firing line getting shoot kill guard right release play pittsburgh crawford ray devise escape claude refuse upset fact right release lead argument result ray claude go separate way year later ray claude elderly age year old duo friend go death release prison willie confine wheelchair dillard run camp day inform ray claude transfer live work superintendent dexter wilkin ned beatty mansion claude form friendship wilkin entrust drive pick new superintendent sheriff warren pike lee ermey man frame year early pheasant hunt ray confront pike sheriff admit frame claude remorse say state mississippi get year cheap labor deal claude struggle stop ray take revenge pike attempt kill shoot kill wilkin realize ray claude innocent cover hunting accident intend pardon die heart attack present day ray claude elderly age year live prison infirmary claude tell ray plan devise ray accept fate die prison night infirmary catch fire seemingly perish flame willie conclude tale outline claude plan ray claude steal body morgue start blaze plant body hide fire truck depart morning worker ask plan work willie tell say work inmate begin realize body bury ray claude escape new york watch new york yankees baseball game film conclude reveal good term live harlem

Insomnia,thriller,"In the small fishing town of Nightmute, Alaska, 17-year-old Kay Connell is found murdered. LAPD detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are sent to assist the local police with their investigation, at the request of police chief Nyback, an old colleague of Dormer's. Ellie Burr, a young local detective who is also a fan of Dormer's investigative work, picks them up when they arrive. Back in LA, Internal Affairs is investigating Dormer. Flying to Alaska, Eckhart reveals that he is going to provide testimony against Dormer in exchange for immunity, to which Dormer responds that many criminals whom he helped to convict using questionable evidence could go free if their cases are reopened.
Dormer attracts the murderer to the scene of the crime, but the suspect flees into the fog, shooting one of the police officers through the leg. Dormer spots a figure in the fog and fires with his backup weapon. Rushing to the fallen figure, Dormer picks up a .38 pistol the suspect has dropped. He then discovers that he has shot Eckhart. Because of Eckhart's pending testimony, Dormer thinks that Internal Affairs will never believe the shooting was an accident, so he claims that Eckhart was shot by the suspect. He doesn't mention he has the .38 pistol. Burr is put in charge of the shooting investigation, and her team finds the .38 caliber bullet that hit the officer. That night, Dormer walks to an alley and fires the .38 pistol into an animal carcass, then retrieves and cleans the bullet. At the morgue, the staffer hands him the bagged bullet retrieved from Eckhart's body but she is unfamiliar with its type. Dormer leaves and switches the .38 bullet for the 9mm slug from Eckhart's body.
Over the next few days, Dormer is plagued by insomnia, brought on by his guilt over killing Eckhart and exacerbated by the perpetual daylight. Dormer starts receiving anonymous phone calls from the killer, who claims to have witnessed Dormer kill his partner. When the police learn that Kay was a fan of local crime writer Walter Finch, Dormer breaks into Finch's apartment in the nearby village of Umkumiut. Finch arrives home, realizes the police are present, and evades Dormer after a chase. Dormer returns to Finch's apartment and plants the .38 to frame Finch.
Finch contacts Dormer and arranges a meeting on a ferry. Finch wants help in shifting suspicion to Kay's abusive boyfriend Randy Stetz and will stay silent about the Eckhart shooting in return. Dormer gives advice on handling police questioning. After Finch leaves Dormer on the ferry, he shows the detective a tape recorder he used to record the conversation.
Finch calls Dormer and tells him that Kay's death was ""an accident""–he beat her to death in a fit of rage after she rejected his advances. The next day, Finch gives false testimony at the police station. When Finch claims Randy has a gun, Dormer realizes Finch has discovered his plant, and has hidden it at Randy's home. Randy is arrested when the gun is found at his house. Finch asks Burr to come to his lake house the next day, to collect letters indicating that Randy abused Kay.
Burr returns to the scene of Eckhart's death and finds a 9mm shell casing, which conflicts with the bullet type from Eckhart's body. She reads old case files from investigations Dormer was involved in and learns he has carried a 9mm, leading her to suspect that he shot Eckhart. Meanwhile, Dormer confides in the hotel owner, Rachel Clement, about the Internal Affairs investigation: he fabricated evidence to help convict a pedophile he was certain was guilty of murdering a child.
Dormer learns that Burr has gone to Finch's. He finds Kay's letters in Finch's apartment and realizes that Finch intends to kill Burr. He learns of Finch's lake house and rushes there. At the house, Finch knocks Burr unconscious just as Dormer arrives. Dormer is too disoriented from lack of sleep to fight off Finch. Burr revives and saves Dormer, while Finch escapes. Burr reveals she knows Dormer shot Eckhart, and he admits that he is no longer certain if it was an accident. From his shed, Finch shoots at them with a shotgun, and Burr returns fire while Dormer sneaks around to Finch's location. After a scuffle in which the men inadvertently exchange weapons, Finch shoots Dormer with the 9mm pistol, and Dormer shoots and kills Finch with the shotgun. Burr rushes to the fatally wounded Dormer and comforts him by affirming that Eckhart's shooting was accidental, then moves to throw away the 9mm shell casing to preserve Dormer's secret. Dormer stops Burr, however, telling her not to lose her way and asks her to let him sleep.",thriller small fishing town nightmute alaska year old kay connell find murder lapd detective dormer hap eckhart send assist local police investigation request police chief nyback old colleague dormer ellie burr young local detective fan dormer investigative work pick arrive la internal affair investigate dormer fly alaska eckhart reveal go provide testimony dormer exchange immunity dormer respond criminal help convict questionable evidence free case reopen dormer attract murderer scene crime suspect flee fog shoot police officer leg dormer spot figure fog fire backup weapon rush fall figure dormer pick pistol suspect drop discover shoot eckhart eckhart pende testimony dormer think internal affair believe shooting accident claim eckhart shoot suspect mention pistol burr charge shooting investigation team find caliber bullet hit officer night dormer walk alley fire pistol animal carcass retrieve clean bullet morgue staffer hand bagged bullet retrieve eckhart body unfamiliar type dormer leave switch bullet mm slug eckhart body day dormer plague insomnia bring guilt kill eckhart exacerbate perpetual daylight dormer start receive anonymous phone call killer claim witness dormer kill partner police learn kay fan local crime writer walter finch dormer break finch apartment nearby village umkumiut finch arrive home realize police present evade dormer chase dormer return finch apartment plant frame finch finch contact dormer arrange meeting ferry finch want help shift suspicion kay abusive boyfriend randy stetz stay silent eckhart shoot return dormer give advice handle police question finch leave dormer ferry show detective tape recorder record conversation finch call dormer tell kay death beat death fit rage reject advance day finch give false testimony police station finch claim randy gun dormer realize finch discover plant hide randy home randy arrest gun find house finch ask burr come lake house day collect letter indicate randy abuse kay burr return scene eckhart death find mm shell casing conflict bullet type eckhart body read old case file investigation dormer involve learn carry mm lead suspect shoot eckhart dormer confide hotel owner rachel clement internal affair investigation fabricate evidence help convict pedophile certain guilty murder child dormer learn burr go finch find kay letter finch apartment realize finch intend kill burr learn finch lake house rush house finch knock burr unconscious dormer arrive dormer disorient lack sleep fight finch burr revive save dormer finch escape burr reveal know dormer shot eckhart admit long certain accident shed finch shoot shotgun burr return fire dormer sneak finch location scuffle man inadvertently exchange weapon finch shoot dormer mm pistol dormer shoot kill finch shotgun burr rush fatally wound dormer comfort affirm eckhart shooting accidental move throw away mm shell casing preserve dormer secret dormer stop burr tell lose way ask let sleep

No Man's Land,crime drama,"When an undercover detective is shot dead while investigating a string of Porsche 911 thefts, Lieutenant Vincent Bracey assigns 22-year-old San Diego officer Benjamin ""Benjy"" Taylor to infiltrate a Porsche garage suspected to be a front for the grand theft auto scheme. Benjy is chosen because of his extensive mechanical knowledge of German cars and his rookie status, which dissuades others from suspecting that he is a cop. Bracey wants Benjy to obtain evidence that millionaire playboy Ted Varrick is the mastermind behind the thefts and the murder of the detective.
Using the alias ""Billy Ayles"", Benjy moves to Los Angeles and gets a job at Technique Porsche as a mechanic. After Benjy fixes Ted's Porsche one night, the two men become close friends, and Benjy becomes romantically attached to Ted's sister Ann. Benjy also discovers the presence of a rival syndicate led by Frank Martin, which leads him to believe that Ted is not the prime suspect despite Bracey's insistence.
Eventually, Ted brings Benjy into his side business of stealing Porsches, with garage manager Malcolm coordinating the operations. Benjy's first few attempts at stealing cars fail miserably, with Martin's syndicate catching on and slashing his hand as a warning. While doing a job at the mall, Benjy and Ted are confronted by Frank and his thugs, but they manage to lose them in a lengthy car chase. Ted rewards Benjy with a red Porsche that night. The next day, Ted goes to Technique Porsche and finds Malcolm has been murdered. In retaliation, he kills Frank at a night club.

The next night, Ted has Benjy meet Loos at a warehouse for a payoff. When Loos tries to kill Benjy, Ted runs him over to save his friend in spite of what he knows.

Bracey kicks Benjy out, but tells him to call in the morning so they can work things out. Benji drives off, unaware that Ted is nearby, spying on him.
The next day, Benjy's cover is blown in front of Ann when his uncle Mike pays him a visit at his apartment. He goes to Bracey's house, only to find that Ted has murdered him.

The Charge of the Light Brigade,war,"The film is about the folly of war, and the poor state of the British Army and its leadership during the Crimean War (1853–56). Britain had not fought in a European theatre since the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, and the army had become sclerotic and bound by bureaucracy. Tactical and logistical methodology had not advanced in forty years, and the whole ethos of the army was bound in outmoded social values.
The anti-hero is a relatively competent officer, Captain Louis Nolan (David Hemmings). A veteran of the Indian Army, Nolan is unusual in the hierarchy of his day both for having combat experience and for having acquired his commission through merited promotion as opposed to purchase. As such he regards many of his colleagues, who are mostly aristocratic dilettantes casual about squandering their subordinates' lives, with contempt.
Nolan's superior is the gruff Lord Cardigan (Trevor Howard), who treats the regiment under his command as his personal property and who dislikes Nolan as an ""Indian"" officer with a native Indian servant. Cardigan's men are typical of the common soldiers of their day; though reasonably well-equipped - compared with the Russians - they are also poorly trained and supplied. They endure squalid living conditions and are punished mercilessly for the slightest missteps in their duties. Nolan soon gets into a highly publicised feud with Cardigan, who is angry at him for ordering Moselle wine at a banquet where all guests were to drink champagne.
British forces are led by Lord Raglan (John Gielgud), a Waterloo veteran and an amiable, vague-minded man who proves a poor commander. Despite having been a disciple of the recently deceased Duke of Wellington for decades, he has not his military flair. As campaign preparations begin he is preoccupied with a bad mistake he made while allotting commands, requiring Lord Cardigan to lead the Light Cavalry Brigade under his equally unpleasant arch-rival and brother-in-law Lord Lucan (Harry Andrews), who has been appointed to command the Cavalry Division. Captain Nolan, enlisted as Raglan's aide, is glad to get away from Britain; it gives him an escape from the morally uneasy affair he has been having with Clarissa Morris (Vanessa Redgrave), the wife of his best friend William (Mark Burns). Also travelling with the British command is the 8th Hussars' paymaster's wife named Fanny Duberly (Jill Bennett), who wants to observe battle first-hand (and be near Lord Cardigan, with whom she is infatuated).
Britain and its ally France travel to the Crimea, where they march inland to attack the strategically important city of Sebastopol. Along the way the British forces are ravaged by cholera, an occurrence met with palpable indifference by their commanders. Captain Nolan, although no friend of his subordinates, is frightened to see the army's organisation fall apart as men are consumed by the disease. When the outbreak passes, British and French forces win at Alma, but Lord Raglan refuses to allow the cavalry to press the advantage, so concerned is he with keeping the cavalry as an undamaged reserve. As a result, the Russians reinforce the road to Sebastopol, necessitating a series of further battles before the British even reach the city. Back in England the press lies that the city is captured and Russia's government humbled. As the war progresses Lord Cardigan retires nightly to the yacht he keeps on the coastline to hold formal dinners, at one of which he seduces Mrs. Duberly.
Captain Nolan has been growing increasingly exasperated at the ineptitude of Raglan and the other officers, which has caused needless death and delay at every step. His emotions reach a tipping point when at the Battle of Balaclava, a Russian raiding party captures an improperly defended British fortification, carrying away several pieces of artillery. Lord Raglan is slow to respond, and Nolan demands he take steps to recover the valuable equipment. Raglan issues badly worded orders, that the cavalry leaders misinterpret. Nolan secures another. The British cavalrymen are in a valley that branches off in two directions; one contains the escaping raiders, the other an artillery battery and a sizeable reserve of Russian cavalry. Lord Raglan did not bother to mention this in his order, since the lay of the land is obvious from his high vantage point. Cardigan, at his lower level, can only see the valley with the cannons, and assumes that he must charge into this. When he queries the order, Nolan loses his temper and gestures vaguely with his arm, shouting ""There, my Lord, is your enemy and there are your guns!"" (these, or something close to them, were his actual words). As the cavalry advances into cannon fire Nolan - who has gained permission from his friend Morris to ride with Cardigan's light brigade as they chase the Russians - realises his mistake, but is killed by shrapnel before he can warn Cardigan. This is 'The Charge of the Light Brigade'.
The Light Brigade, torn apart by the cannons, clashes briefly with the Russians and then retreats. With most of his force dead or wounded, Lord Cardigan who led his men valiantly, is ironically unharmed, but he immediately begins bickering with the other officers about who must take the blame for the disaster.

Hood vs. Evil,"animated, family","Wolf (Patrick Warburton), Granny (Glenn Close), and Twitchy (Cory Edwards) are on a rescue mission to save Hansel and Gretel (Bill Hader and Amy Poehler) from an evil witch named Verushka (Joan Cusack). The plan goes wrong however and Granny is kidnapped as well. Meanwhile, Red (Hayden Panettiere) is in training with a mysterious group called the Sisters of the Hood where she learns that a secret all powerful truffle recipe has been stolen. She is assigned by detective Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers) with Wolf and Twitchy to find the recipe and save her grandma.
While getting info at the Giant's (Brad Garrett) nightclub and interrogating his harp, Red and company learn that an incarcerated Boingo the Bunny (Andy Dick) has been having specific ingredients sent to Verushka, (who was also at the prison and narrowly escapes the team.) Red and Wolf argue over who let her get away and the team split up. Meanwhile, Verushka, who stole the truffle recipe, tries to force Granny into making it for her. Granny escapes and finds Hansel and Gretel, but learns that they are actually the masterminds behind the plot. Granny is recaptured and learns that Verushka was an old classmate of hers when they were both in training with the Sisters of the Hood; Verushka was always second best behind Granny's accomplishments and grew jealous of her and teamed up with Hansel and Gretel to get revenge.
After some convincing by Twitchy, Wolf decides to go apologize to Red, but is encountered by The Three Pigs (Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong, and Phil LaMarr) and barely manage to escape. They make it back to HQ to find it abandoned and damaged by Verushka's pig henchmen. On their way to the witch's lair, Wolf and Twitchy rescue Red, who was caught after trying to sneak in first. The two make up and infiltrate Hansel and Gretel's base with help from Kirk the Woodsman (Martin Short) and his yodeling troupe. Red accidentally reveals the final ingredient for the truffle recipe, macadamia nuts, and the truffles are made.
Hansel and Gretel eat the truffles transforming into giants and go on a rampage through the city. They betray Verushka, leaving her to be eaten by a giant spider with the rest and Granny convinces her to join forces with her, Red, Wolf, and Twitchy. They trick Hansel and Gretel into eating more truffles which make them so obese that they can no longer move their arms and legs, before the two are arrested.

Green Mansions,drama,"A young man named Abel (Anthony Perkins) narrowly escapes Caracas, Venezuela after it is overtaken by rebels. He decides to seek revenge, as his father, the former Minister of War, was killed. After getting supplies, he takes a canoe to the far shore, where he is nearly killed by a jaguar, but is saved by the native, Indian-like people.
He decides to prove his bravery by not moving once he sees the chief, Runi (Sessue Hayakawa) and telling his story. The Indians are impressed, and do not kill him. After a while, Runi's son Kua-ko (Henry Silva), who has lived with the missionaries of Caracas and speaks English, tells Abel that Runi has agreed so long as he does not harm them, they will not harm him. Abel agrees, and befriends Kua-ko, who tells him of the ""Bird Woman"", who killed his older brother, and that their tribe is not allowed in the nearby forest.
Abel ignores the warning and ventures into the forest, where he sees a young woman (Audrey Hepburn) who quickly disappears. He returns to the Indians, and Kua-ko tells him that Runi wishes Abel to use his gun and kill the girl. He returns to the forest, but decides to warn the girl instead. He sees her again, but is bitten by a coral snake. The girl takes Abel to her home and tends his wound. Upon waking up, he meets the girl's grandfather, Nuflo (Lee J. Cobb), who tells him her name is Rima.
The next day, with his leg wounded by the snake, Abel meets Rima again and they begin to talk. Rima takes a liking to him, but Nuflo warns her that he will leave once his leg heals. Abel is soon able to walk without a cane, and Rima therefore begins showing him the forest. Abel tells her that he has come to like her as well, and Rima is confused. She goes to speak with her dead mother's spirit, and decides to return to where she came from to ask a village elder about her strange new feelings for Abel. Later, Abel and Rima travel to the edge of the forest, where he shows her Riolama, which she remembers as her village. Despite Nuflo's initial reluctance to take her, Rima forces him to show her the way by threatening his soul if he does not.
Abel decides it is time for him to return to the Indians. He tells Runi of how Rima saved him, but neither he nor Kua-ko believe him. He quickly realizes that Kua-ko killed his brother and placed the blame on Rima, but is tied up. After a bravery test (withstanding bee and wasp stings without making a sound), Kua-ko and the Indians make ready to enter the forest and kill Rima.
Abel escapes and warns Nuflo and Rima, and together they escape to Riolama, where Nuflo tells Abel that he cannot return to the village because he caused a massacre. He managed to help Rima and her mother, and promised to take care of Rima, but was ashamed at his part in the massacre. Rima overhears, and curses Nuflo. She then rushes down to Riolama, where she faints in the heat. Abel follows and takes her to safety. When she awakens, Abel tells her how he has come to love her, and Rima does also, having only come to decipher her strange feelings and now recognizing them as love for him.
Rima steals away while Abel is asleep to go back to Nuflo and apologize, but when she finds him, the Indians have burnt their home and he is nearly dead. She asks his forgiveness, and with his last words Nuflo tries to warn her of the Indians. She quickly discovers for herself, and races through the forest to escape. Kua-ko burns the great tree where she has hidden. Meanwhile, Abel awakens and realizes what Rima has done. He quickly follows and finds Kua-ko, who teases that he killed her. The two fight into a stream, where Abel manages to drown Kua-ko.
Abel remembers a flower Rima told him of, which, if it disappears in one place, blossoms in another close by. He finds the flower, and not far off, Rima herself, who extends her hand.

One Mysterious Night,crime drama,"The Blue Star of the Nile is stolen from an exhibition guarded by the police under Inspector Farraday. Under intense pressure from the police commissioner to recover the diamond, Farraday tells reporters, among them Dorothy Anderson, that he is sure Boston Blackie is responsible. However, he does not really believe that; it is only a ruse. When Blackie walks into Farraday's office, the inspector is so desperate he deputizes his old nemesis to get the jewel back, using his own methods.
Blackie is certain the robbers had inside help. He finds a wad of gum under some of the furniture at the exhibit hall; it still bears the impression of the diamond. Blackie targets George Daley, the assistant manager, especially after he learns that George had recently bought a large amount of gum. He gets sidetracked when Anderson recognizes him and has him arrested, but Farraday soon lets him out the back way.
Daley's sister Eileen finds out that her brother is involved with thieves Paul Martens and Matt Healy, and that he later hid the diamond in her purse. She persuades him to give the jewel to Blackie. However, his former partners show up just after he meets Blackie. In the ensuing scuffle, they kill Daley, and kidnap Blackie and his sidekick, ""the Runt"". The crooks figure that, with Blackie missing and unable to clear himself, he will be suspected of both the robbery and the murder. Indeed, Farraday begins to believe just that.
Blackie tells his captors that what they have is a fake that he intended to switch with the real diamond, supposedly stored in a vault. Uncertain, they take it to fence Jumbo Madigan to get his expert opinion. Blackie manages to free himself and the Runt, and persuades Madigan to go along with his story. However, when the police surround the place, Martens and Healy realize they have been double crossed, and shoot Madigan, though not fatally. When the cops break in, they do not spot the pair, posing as mannequins.
The crooks later return to their apartment. Blackie offers to steal the real diamond. They agree to his arrangement, but keep the Runt as a hostage. Blackie goes to Farraday, who surrounds the building with policemen. Then Blackie and Farraday enter the apartment to negotiate the Runt's release.

The Doors,"drama, biography","The film opens during the recording of Jim's An American Prayer and quickly moves to a childhood memory of his family driving along a desert highway in 1949, where a young Jim sees an elderly Native American dying by the roadside. In 1965, Jim arrives in California and is assimilated into the Venice Beach culture. During his tenure studying at UCLA, he meets his future girlfriend Pamela Courson, and meets Ray Manzarek for the first time, as well as Robby Krieger and John Densmore; who would found The Doors.
Jim convinces his bandmates to travel to Death Valley and experience the effects of psychedelic drugs. Returning to Los Angeles, they play several shows at the famous nightclub Whisky a Go Go and develop a rabid fan base. Jim's onstage antics and occasionally improvised lyrics raise the ire of club owners; however, the band's popularity continues to expand.
As the Doors become very successful, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own image as ""The Lizard King"" and degenerates into alcoholism and drugs. Jim meets Patricia Kennealy, a rock journalist involved in witchcraft, and participates with her in mystical ceremonies. He joins her in a handfasting ceremony. An elder spirit watches these events.
The rest of the band grows weary of Jim's missed recording sessions and absences at concerts. Jim arrives late to a Miami, Florida concert, becoming increasingly confrontational towards the audience and allegedly exposing himself onstage. The incident is a low point for the band, resulting in criminal charges against Jim, cancellations of shows, breakdowns in Jim's personal relationships, and resentment from the other band members.
In 1970, following a lengthy trial, Jim is found guilty of indecent exposure and ordered to serve time in prison. However, he is allowed to remain free on bail pending the results of an appeal. Patricia tells Jim that she is pregnant with his child, but Jim convinces her to have an abortion. Jim visits his fellow bandmates for the last time, attending a party thrown by Ray where he wishes the band luck in their future endeavours and gives each of them a copy of An American Prayer. As Jim plays in the front garden with the children, he sees that one of the children is his childhood self. Jim comments: ""This is the strangest life I've ever known.""
In 1971, Pam finds Jim dead in a bathtub in Paris, France, at the age of 27. The final scenes of the film before the credits roll are of Jim's gravesite in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris while ""The Severed Garden (Adagio)"" plays in the background. Just before the credits, the screen whites out and text appears saying ""Jim Morrison is said to have died of heart failure. He was 27. Pam joined him three years later.""

Itty Bitty Titty Committee,comedy,"Anna has been rejected by her college, her girlfriend broke up with her, and her big sister is getting married. She meets Sadie, who invites her to join Clits In Action, or C(i)A, a radical Third-wave feminist group. Anna soon gets in touch with her political side.[2] She takes part in illegal activism with the group and becomes more aggressive in her daily life.
Anna starts falling for Sadie, who has been involved for years with an older woman named Courtney. Courtney works with a more mainstream feminist organization and disagrees with the C(i)A's method of creating awareness through public art, which usually involves vandalism.
The group travels to take part in a gay marriage protest – instead of being for or against it, they argue that marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism. Despite being warned by another member of the C(i)A, Meat, that Sadie uses people, Anna shares a night of passion with her while they stay in a hotel. At the rally the next day, the outspoken Shulamith ends up nearly coming to blows with a protester. The fight is caught by a local news crew and the group's message is misconstrued as violent and homophobic. Meat also reveals that their website – which they considered the center of their activism – has not received hits from anyone besides themselves.
C(i)A attempts to have a meeting at Courtney's home, but personal conflicts come to a head. Anna believes Sadie is going to leave Courtney to be with her, but Sadie remains dependent on her partner. Meat and Shulamith announce that they're giving up on the group, Sadie stays behind with Courtney, and Aggie (a transgender man who's part of the C(i)A) comforts Anna, who is heartbroken over Sadie's rejection and the loss of the C(i)A. They end up partying together and having a one-night stand. In the morning, Aggie has prepared breakfast and procured a flower for Anna, who only considers him a friend. Sadie arrives to talk about what happened the night before. Anna tries to explain that her night with Aggie meant nothing. He overhears and is deeply hurt. Sadie leaves and Anna finds herself truly alone.
In an attempt to fix things, Anna formulates a master plan to get C(i)A national attention. Meat and Shulamith like her idea, but insist she must make things right with Aggie. Anna apologizes, Aggie forgives her, and the four carry out the plan, without Sadie.
Anna attends her sister's wedding, bringing joy to her family, but leaves early to execute her part of the plan – sneaking into the studio of a popular talk show with Aggie and Meat. Courtney is appearing on the show to argue about the appropriateness of a celebration over the (arbitrary) anniversary of the construction of the Washington Monument, which she feels is a distraction from real issues. When the host requests a live shot of the monument, the C(i)A feeds their footage in. With the expert help of one of Shulamith's lovers, Calvin (who was discharged from the military for being a lesbian under Don't Ask Don't Tell), and Meat's prowess with sculpture, a giant phallus has been erected atop the Washington Monument and is blown off with explosives. Back at the studio, Aggie pulls the fire alarm and the group escapes.
In the getaway car waiting for Anna, she is surprised to see Sadie, who has finally broken it off with Courtney. Sadie apologizes for her behavior, and the two agree to just be friends, but then kiss. Through text in the epilogue, it is revealed that Shulamith and Calvin volunteered to take the fall for the explosion, and received a reduced sentence because no one was hurt. Aggie started hormone therapy, started a new feminist group for men and got a girlfriend. Meat's sculpture appearing on TV launched her art career. Courtney took the talk show host, Marcy, out to dinner after fleeing the building together. Marcy subsequently left her husband to move in with Courtney. Anna and Sadie remain together, and Anna now attends college, where she has created a group focused on positive body image called the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.",comedy anna reject college girlfriend break big sister getting marry meet sadie invite join clit action radical wave feminist group anna soon get touch political take illegal activism group aggressive daily life anna start fall sadie involve year old woman name courtney courtney work mainstream feminist organization disagree method create awareness public art usually involve vandalism group travel gay marriage protest instead argue marriage wrong goal institution root sexism despite warn member meat sadie use people anna share night passion stay hotel rally day outspoken shulamith end nearly come blow protester fight catch local news crew group message misconstrue violent homophobic meat reveal website consider center activism receive hit attempt meeting courtney home personal conflict come head anna believe sadie go leave courtney sadie remain dependent partner meat shulamith announce give group sadie stay courtney aggie transgender man comfort anna heartbroken sadie rejection loss end party have night stand morning aggie prepare breakfast procure flower anna consider friend sadie arrive talk happen night anna try explain night aggie mean overhear deeply hurt sadie leave anna find truly attempt fix thing anna formulate master plan national attention meat shulamith like idea insist thing right aggie anna apologizes aggie forgive carry plan sadie anna attend sister wedding bring joy family leave early execute plan sneak studio popular talk aggie meat courtney appear argue appropriateness celebration arbitrary anniversary construction washington monument feel distraction real issue host request live shot monument feed footage expert help shulamith lover calvin discharge military lesbian ask tell meat prowess sculpture giant phallus erect atop washington monument blow explosive studio aggie pull fire alarm group escape getaway car wait anna surprised sadie finally break courtney sadie apologize behavior agree friend kiss text epilogue reveal shulamith calvin volunteer fall explosion receive reduce sentence hurt aggie start hormone therapy start new feminist group man get girlfriend meat sculpture appear tv launch art career courtney take talk host marcy dinner flee building marcy subsequently leave husband courtney anna sadie remain anna attend college create group focus positive body image call itty bitty titty committee
Baseball Bugs,animated,"A baseball game is going on in New York City at the Polo Grounds (but the depiction of the frieze on the top deck was borrowed from Yankee Stadium), between the visiting Gas-House Gorillas and the home team, the Tea Totallers. The game is not going well for the home team as the Gorillas, a group of oversized rough-necks, are not only dominating the Tea Totallers, made up of old men, but intimidating the umpire by knocking him into the ground like a tent peg after an unpopular judgment. The Gorillas' home runs go screaming, literally, out of the ballpark and the batters form a conga line, each hitter whacking a ball out.
Bugs Bunny, watching from his hole in the outfield, is fed up with the unfair game and the Gas-House Gorillas playing dirty. He talks trash against the Gorillas, claiming that he could win the game single-handed with an endless barrage of home runs. He loses a bit of his bravado when he suddenly gets surrounded by the Gorillas. They force him to take up his own challenge and, as a result, Bugs now has to play all the positions on the opposing team, including speeding from the mound to behind the plate to catch his own pitches.
Bugs throws his fastball so hard that it zips by the Gorillas' batter but, as he catches it, he is propelled off- screen, crashing into the backstop. In the course of his dual role, he shouts encouraging words to the pitcher before going back to the mound to make the next pitch, then returning to home plate to catch it. Next, Bugs decides to ""perplex 'em with [his] slowball"", throwing a pitch so slow that three Gorillas in a row strike out attempting to hit it.
For his first time up, Bugs selects a bat from the batboy, a literal hybrid of a bat and a boy. As promised, Bugs starts smacking the ball. On the first pitch, he makes a long hit, dashing around the bases while also showing off for the crowd, only to find a grinning Gorilla holding the ball just ahead of the plate. To allow himself to score his first run, Bugs pulls out a pin-up poster, which distracts the Gorilla player. The scoreboard now shows the Gorillas as the home team, with 96 runs, and Bugs batting in the top of the fifth with one run so far.
Bugs hits another one deep, and while rounding the bases, a Gorilla ambushes the plate umpire and puts on his uniform. Bugs slides into home, obviously safe, but the fake umpire calls him out. Bugs gets in his face, actually behind the umpire mask, and argues the call, pulling his time-honored word-switching gag until the umpire ends up demanding that Bugs accept the safe call or go to the showers. Bugs gives in, and the faux-umpire gets wise too late as the board flashes another run.
Bugs hammers the next pitch on a line drive that bounces off each Gorilla with a ping sound as in a pinball game. The scoreboard then blinks a random series of numbers and the word ""Tilted.""
The story jumps ahead to the final inning, announced by a radio-style jingle, with Bugs leading 96–95, the Gorillas having lost a run somewhere along the way. Blanc's voice is now heard as the announcer as the radio booth has lost its original play-by-play man. With two outs in the last of the ninth, a Gorilla is on base and another, menacingly swinging a bat he has just fashioned from a huge tree, is ready for the pitch.
Bugs proceeds with a tremendous wind-up, lets the pitch go, and the ball is rocketed out of the stadium. Startled, Bugs desperately gives chase. He grabs a cab and is almost led astray until he realizes a Gorilla is driving it; he jumps out and catches a bus which takes him to the ""Umpire State Building'.

Once Upon a Time in Anatolia,drama,"Through the night, three cars carry a small group of men – police officers, a doctor, a prosecutor, grave diggers, gendarmerie forces, and two brothers, homicide suspects – around in the rural surroundings of the Anatolian town Keskin, in search of a buried body. Kenan, one of the suspects, leads them from one water fountain to another; at the time of the crime he was drunk and he cannot recall where he and his mentally challenged brother buried the body. The darkness and visual indistinctness of the landscape do not help; each spot looks the same as the others.
Meanwhile, the men discuss a variety of topics, such as yoghurt, lamb chops, urination, family, spouses, ex-wives, death, suicide, hierarchy, bureaucracy, ethics, and their jobs. Philosophy is also discussed, with one apparently central and particular idea/theme mentioned a couple of times throughout the film—the idea that children invariably pay for their parents' mistakes.
After many stops the prosecutor begins to tell the doctor about a particularly mysterious death where a woman correctly predicted to her husband the exact date of her own death, which was a short time after she had given birth to a child. The story is interrupted when the prosecutor sees some of his men lashing out at Kenan after discovering that once again they are in the wrong spot. As the group discusses what to do next, Kenan asks the doctor for a cigarette which he tries to give him. Commisar Naci stops him however and tells Kenan that he can have a cigarette when he earns it.
The group stops at a nearby village to eat at the home of the town mayor. The mayor pleads with the prosecutor to speak to the authorities of his town to help provide funds to build a morgue where bodies can be prepared. When some of the men suggest that he simply bury the bodies quickly the man informs them that emigration means that only old people are left in the town and when their children learn of their deaths they beg him not to bury the bodies immediately so that they may come back and see their parents one last time.
The wind causes a power outage during which the mayor's young daughter brings the men tea on a tray, with a lamp on the tray lighting her face. Several of the men are struck by her beauty. After seeing her Kenan begins to cry.
While waiting for the light to come back on the doctor asks about the cause of death of the woman who predicted her own death. and the prosecutor says it was natural, a heart attack. The doctor then asks whether an autopsy was performed, and the prosecutor replies that there was no need as the cause of death was obvious and unsuspicious. The doctor suggests that it may have been a self-induced heart attack with the use of drugs and therefore a suicide.
Meanwhile, Kenan reveals what happened the night of the killing – while drunk he let slip the secret that the victim's son was actually his, and then things got ugly. After confessing to the comissar he is given a cigarette.
Daylight breaks. Kenan finally takes them to the correct location where the group is able to unearth the body which they discover to their horror has been hogtied. Needing to take the body to the hospital to be autopsied they realize that they do not have a body bag and that the body, now untied, had been tied by Kenan in order to make it fit in the trunk of his car. After contemplating whether to tie the body up again they succeed in making it fit by bending the corpse.
The mother and son (perhaps 12 years old) are waiting outside the hospital. The son throws a stone at Kenan hitting him between the eyes. Kenan cries.
At the hospital the prosecutor again discusses the woman who predicted her own death with the doctor. They further discuss the possibility of suicide, where it is established that a certain prescription drug could have been used to induce the heart attack. The prosecutor is familiar with the drug as his father-in-law took it for his heart problems. Possible reasons for suicide are also discussed, and the two come to a possible motive—her husband's confirmed infidelity. At the end of the discussion the prosecutor's behavior suggests that the woman may have been his own wife.
The prosecutor invites the victim's wife to identify the body in the hospital morgue, files the necessary paperwork, and departs, leaving the doctor to perform the autopsy. The autopsy reveals the presence of soil in the lungs, implying that the victim had been buried alive, but the doctor intentionally omits that from the report.
The movie ends with a shot from the doctor's perspective of the mother and son in the distance walking away with the husband's belongings. The son sees that a soccer ball has been accidentally kicked far from a schoolyard and he runs and retrieves it and kicks it back to the children in the yard. He then runs back to his mother.",drama night car carry small group man police officer doctor prosecutor grave digger gendarmerie force brother homicide suspect rural surrounding anatolian town keskin search bury body kenan suspect lead water fountain time crime drunk recall mentally challenge brother bury body darkness visual indistinctness landscape help spot look man discuss variety topic yoghurt lamb chop urination family spouse ex wife death suicide hierarchy bureaucracy ethic job philosophy discuss apparently central particular idea theme mention couple time film idea child invariably pay parent mistake stop prosecutor begin tell doctor particularly mysterious death woman correctly predict husband exact date death short time give birth child story interrupt prosecutor see man lash kenan discover wrong spot group discuss kenan ask doctor cigarette try commisar naci stop tell kenan cigarette earn group stop nearby village eat home town mayor mayor plead prosecutor speak authority town help provide fund build morgue body prepare man suggest simply bury body quickly man inform emigration mean old people leave town child learn death beg bury body immediately come parent time wind cause power outage mayor young daughter bring man tea tray lamp tray light face man strike beauty see kenan begin cry wait light come doctor ask cause death woman predict death prosecutor say natural heart attack doctor ask autopsy perform prosecutor reply need cause death obvious unsuspicious doctor suggest self induce heart attack use drug suicide kenan reveal happen night killing drunk let slip secret victim son actually thing get ugly confess comissar give cigarette daylight break kenan finally take correct location group able unearth body discover horror hogtie need body hospital autopsie realize body bag body untie tie kenan order fit trunk car contemplate tie body succeed make fit bend corpse mother son year old wait outside hospital son throw stone kenan hit eye kenan cry hospital prosecutor discuss woman predict death doctor discuss possibility suicide establish certain prescription drug induce heart attack prosecutor familiar drug father law take heart problem possible reason suicide discuss come possible motive husband confirm infidelity end discussion prosecutor behavior suggest woman wife prosecutor invite victim wife identify body hospital morgue file necessary paperwork depart leave doctor perform autopsy autopsy reveal presence soil lung imply victim bury alive doctor intentionally omit report movie end shot doctor perspective mother son distance walk away husband belonging son see soccer ball accidentally kick far schoolyard run retrieve kick child yard run mother

A Warrior's Tail,"animation, produced by glukoza production","In a small village a young boy named Savva is told a story about the White Wolves who protected humans for thousands of years. But when the wolves turned against humans a powerful magician turned them all into beasts.
The village is attacked by Hyenas who announce that the villagers will be sold as slaves. Savva is forced to flee and is rescued by a white wolf named Anggee. He offers to take Savva to a magician who knows a warrior that can save the village, though they will have to get past Mom Jozee, the three headed monkey queen. They come across a small pink creature named Puffy, who claims he is an enchanted prince seeking the magician to return him to normal. They also save an ugly man named Fafl, who also claims he is an enchanted prince, a once handsome semi-baron who rejected the love of a witch and was cursed with ugliness, and also to suffer the presence of the Mosquito King until the two of them can agree on something, something Fafl’s pride would never allow him to do. Mom Jozee learns of the group’s presence and orders her spies to follow them.
Puffy is kidnapped by natives who live in a nearby swamp, believing him to be their god, Makatunga. The tribe also captures Savva, Anggee and Fafl who were being watched by Mom Jozee’s spies and warriors known as Rickies. Savva, Anggee and Fafl meet the tribal leader, Shaman Shisha, and his granddaughter, Nanty, who develops a crush on Savva. Shaman Shisha had previously used his voodoo magic to partially break Anggee’s curse, allowing him to become a white wolf again. Shaman Shisha tells Savva the tribe intends to help Makatunga return to heaven, though that would require Puffy’s death. Savva rescues Puffy from the temple, but they are followed by Nanty, who asks to join them.
That night Nanty witnesses Anggee transform into a Rickie. Savva accuses Anggee of lying to him and forces him to leave but is kidnapped by another Rickie on the orders of Anggee’s father. Mom Jozee learns from her spies that the Rickies are actually the white wolves and declares war on the Rickies to prevent the white wolves from returning.
Anggee confronts his father, who has no desire to become a white wolf again, and refuses to help, but does let Savva go. After reuniting with Nanty, Fafl and Puffy, Anggee explains that his father, who had almost starved, attacked a human, causing every white wolf to be turned into Rickies, and because the white wolves believed themselves powerful, they were cursed to fear the smallest animal in the forest, mosquitos, whose bite can kill Rickies.
As the monkey army approaches they are joined by the natives and by the Rickies, sent by Anggee’s father after learning the monkeys had declared war. As the monkey and Rickie armies fight Mom Jozee orders a swarm of mosquitos to kill the Rickies. With the Mosquito King the only one who can stop the swarm Fafl is forced to agree with him, finally separating them. With their king returned the swarm attacks the monkeys. With the monkeys defeated Savva and the others travel to the magician’s home. The magician, who is actually a little girl, grants everyone’s requests. Fafl is returned to his original appearance and granted the title of Full-Baron. Anggee and the Rickies become white wolves again. Puffy, who was not really an enchanted prince, desires nothing as he now has friends. Savva is directed to another room to find the warrior, but instead finds a mirror. Realising he has found the warrior he needs Savva returns to his villageand defeats the hyenas leader, who promises to never attack the village again.
With the village free Anggee shares an emotional goodbye with Savva before leaving to become the white wolves’ new king. Fafl, tired of his old life as a semi-baron, decides to continue travelling the world with Puffy. Nanty stays in the village with Savva, who is upset that he may never see Anggee again. However Anggee, who had not intended to leave forever, returns to the village and is happily reunited with Savva.",animation produce glukoza production small village young boy name savva tell story white wolf protect human thousand year wolf turn human powerful magician turn beast village attack hyena announce villager sell slave savva force flee rescue white wolf name anggee offer savva magician know warrior save village past mom jozee head monkey queen come small pink creature name puffy claim enchanted prince seek magician return normal save ugly man name fafl claim enchanted prince handsome semi baron reject love witch curse ugliness suffer presence mosquito king agree fafl pride allow mom jozee learn group presence order spy follow puffy kidnap native live nearby swamp believe god makatunga tribe capture savva anggee fafl watch mom jozee spy warrior know rickie savva anggee fafl meet tribal leader shaman shisha granddaughter nanty develop crush savva shaman shisha previously voodoo magic partially break anggee curse allow white wolf shaman shisha tell savva tribe intend help makatunga return heaven require puffy death savva rescue puffy temple follow nanty ask join night nanty witness anggee transform rickie savva accuse anggee lie force leave kidnap rickie order anggee father mom jozee learn spy rickie actually white wolf declare war rickie prevent white wolf return anggee confront father desire white wolf refuse help let savva reunite nanty fafl puffy anggee explain father starve attack human cause white wolf turn rickie white wolf believe powerful curse fear small animal forest mosquito bite kill rickie monkey army approach join native rickie send anggee father learn monkey declare war monkey rickie army fight mom jozee order swarm mosquito kill rickie mosquito king stop swarm fafl force agree finally separate king return swarm attack monkey monkey defeat savva travel magician home magician actually little girl grant request fafl return original appearance grant title baron anggee rickie white wolf puffy enchanted prince desire friend savva direct room find warrior instead find mirror realise find warrior need savva return villageand defeat hyenas leader promise attack village village free anggee share emotional goodbye savva leave white wolf new king fafl tired old life semi baron decide continue travel world puffy nanty stay village savva upset anggee anggee intend leave forever return village happily reunite savva
Thundercrack!,"adult, horror","The story begins during a thunderstorm. The house, which is shown in the opening shot, named Prairie Blossom, is very clearly fake which lends itself to comedic value. A caller, Willene Cassidy (Maggie Pyle), pays a visit to the house owner, Mrs. Gert Hammond (Marion Eaton), who is very drunk. She insists that she make herself presentable before she answers the door. This takes a very long time and she makes a bad job of putting on her makeup. In an effort to get the alcohol out of her system she makes herself vomit by putting her fingers down her throat. Finally, having retrieved her wig from the toilet, where it fell during her vomiting, she is ready to greet her visitor. Willene is shocked at the dishevelled appearance of Mrs. Hammond and insist on giving her a bath. Willene explains that her husband is a very famous yet untalented country music star, Simon Cassidy, whose music is heard on the radio during the later scene. During the course of the bath, Willene unintentionally masturbates Mrs. Hammond. It is also revealed that Mr. Hammond died and that their son ""no longer exists"".
As the night goes on, more and more visitors appear to shelter from the storm. Among them is Chandler (Mookie Blodgett), widower of the incredibly wealthy Sarah Lou Phillips, whose family owns the largest girdle factory in the United States. Their popularity is such that few American women are without one. Chandler relates the story of his wife's death. She burned to death at a cocktail party, where there was a freak accident and her girdle caught fire. This caused burning rubber to envelop her head, and finally she fell dead into the swimming pool, her head steaming. This causes Chandler to have a bizarre sexual dysfunction. Although initially attracted to women, they would invariably prove to be owners of House of Phillips girdles. When they took off their clothes before sex, he would be reminded of the death of his wife and would not be able to maintain an erection. For this reason he had been having sex with other men, as they don't wear girdles that would remind him of Sarah Lou's horrific immolation. Rather strangely, during the telling of this story, Chandler is being fellated by Sash (Melinda McDowell) and has no apparent erectile problems. The two, while in the basement, discover that Mrs. Hammond had pickled the remains of her husband and kept them in a jar. She tells of the death of her husband, who had been working one day in the grain bin and got covered with grain dust. A swarm of locusts dove on him to eat the dust and in the process devoured much of Mr. Hammond's body.
During the course of the night, many of the guests have sex with each other in various combinations. There are a great many sex toys at Prairie Blossom. Mrs. Hammond explains that her son collected them. They would be delivered in plain brown packages which she would take to him with his morning breakfast. This causes her to wistfully repeat that he ""no longer exists"". One of the guests, a man named Toydy, becomes obsessed with finding the key to a locked door in the house. One of the female guests, Roo (Moira Benson), finds the key but will not give it to Toydy (Rick Johnson) unless he agrees to ejaculate in her mouth. Despite not finding her attractive, Toydy agrees and manages to stay aroused by watching Bond (Ken Scudder) and Willene have sex.
The final human guest at Prairie Blossom, Bing (George Kuchar), arrives in an agitated state. He had come from the circus in a vehicle containing a toothless lion, a near-blind elephant, and a female gorilla named Medusa. He explains to the group that Medusa is extremely dangerous and is likely to kill anyone she comes across. It is revealed that Bing himself is the cause of the apes murderous tendencies. His circus-mates, having got Bing drunk, convinced him to have sex with a prostitute. Despite her being hirsute, Bing is too drunk to decline. The next morning, he awakens to the pleasant feeling of being masturbated, though to his horror, the act is being carried out by Medusa, who now has a severe crush on him. She soon realises that her feelings are not being reciprocated and becomes enraged with him, and indeed all men. However, subsequent mistreatment by a female circus-worker causes these feelings to spread to women as well. The only way to calm Medusa is by giving her bananas.
Toydy, having watched Bond and Willene have sex, decides to lie to Bond in order to have sex with him. Toydy says that he has a crate of bananas and will give them to Bond if he will have sex with him. Bond considers this carefully, not having had a homosexual encounter before, but agrees on the strength that he and Willene (who has by now forgotten about her husband) can use the bananas to escape the murderous primate. On discovering the deception, Bond takes it in his stride and tells Willene he had to be broken in sometime. He jokes that if things don't work out between himself and her, he can always try for her husband.
Meanwhile, Toydy having gained the key to the locked door earlier opens it with Roo to discover Prairie Blossom's terrible secret. By morning, the fate of Roo and Toydy is unknown to the others. Chandler and Sash leave together, as do Bond and Willene, though Bond tells her he likes to sleep around too much to really settle down. Bing has married Medusa, though for some reason, he wore the wedding dress. Mrs. Hammond, alone with the jar containing her husband, proposes a toast to love, and pours Mr. Hammond's drink into his jar.[3]",adult horror story begin thunderstorm house show opening shot name prairie blossom clearly fake lend comedic value caller willene cassidy maggie pyle pay visit house owner mrs gert hammond marion eaton drunk insist presentable answer door take long time make bad job put makeup effort alcohol system make vomit put finger throat finally having retrieve wig toilet fall vomiting ready greet visitor willene shock dishevel appearance mrs hammond insist give bath willene explain husband famous untalented country music star simon cassidy music hear radio later scene course bath willene unintentionally masturbate mrs hammond reveal mr hammond die son long exist night go visitor appear shelter storm chandler mookie blodgett widower incredibly wealthy sarah lou phillips family own large girdle factory united states popularity american woman chandler relate story wife death burn death cocktail party freak accident girdle catch fire cause burn rubber envelop head finally fall dead swimming pool head steam cause chandler bizarre sexual dysfunction initially attract woman invariably prove owner house phillip girdle take clothe sex remind death wife able maintain erection reason have sex man wear girdle remind sarah lou horrific immolation strangely telling story chandler fellate sash melinda mcdowell apparent erectile problem basement discover mrs hammond pickle remain husband keep jar tell death husband work day grain bin get cover grain dust swarm locust dive eat dust process devour mr hammond body course night guest sex combination great sex toy prairie blossom mrs hammond explain son collect deliver plain brown package morning breakfast cause wistfully repeat long exist guest man name toydy obsess find key locked door house female guest roo moira benson find key toydy rick johnson agree ejaculate mouth despite find attractive toydy agree manage stay arouse watch bond ken scudder willene sex final human guest prairie blossom bing george kuchar arrive agitated state come circus vehicle contain toothless lion near blind elephant female gorilla name medusa explain group medusa extremely dangerous likely kill come reveal bing cause ape murderous tendency circus mate having got bing drink convince sex prostitute despite hirsute bing drunk decline morning awaken pleasant feeling masturbate horror act carry medusa severe crush soon realise feeling reciprocate enraged man subsequent mistreatment female circus worker cause feeling spread woman way calm medusa give banana toydy having watch bond willene sex decide lie bond order sex toydy say crate banana bond sex bond consider carefully having homosexual encounter agree strength willene forget husband use banana escape murderous primate discover deception bond take stride tell willene break joke thing work try husband toydy having gain key locked door early open roo discover prairie blossom terrible secret morning fate roo toydy unknown chandler sash leave bond willene bond tell like sleep settle bing marry medusa reason wear wedding dress mrs hammond jar contain husband propose toast love pour mr hammond drink
A Civil Action,drama,"Environmental toxins in the city of Woburn, Massachusetts contaminate the area's water supply, and become linked to a number of deaths of neighboring children. Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta), a cocky and successful Boston attorney who zips around town in his Porsche, and his small firm of personal injury lawyers are asked by Woburn resident Anne Anderson (Kathleen Quinlan) to take legal action against those responsible.
After originally rejecting a seemingly unprofitable case, Jan finds a major environmental issue involving groundwater contamination that has great legal potential and a couple of defendants with deep pockets. The local tanneries could be responsible for several deadly cases of leukemia, but also are the main employers for the area. Jan decides to go forward against two giant corporations (real-life companies Beatrice Foods and W. R. Grace and Company) with links to the tanneries, thinking that the case could possibly earn him millions, as well as enhancing his and his firm's already considerable reputation.
Bringing a class action lawsuit in federal court, Jan represents families who demand a clean-up of contaminated areas and an apology. However, the case develops a life of its own and takes over the lives of Jan and his firm. The lawyers for the tanneries' parent corporations are not easy to intimidate, a judge (John Lithgow) makes a key ruling against the plaintiffs, and soon Jan and his partners find themselves in a position where their professional and financial survival has been staked on the outcome of the case.
Jan stubbornly declines settlement offers, gradually coming to believe that the case is about more than just the money. He allows his pride to take over, making outrageous demands and deciding that he must win at all costs. Pressures take their toll, with Jan and his partners going deeply into debt. After a lengthy trial, the case is dismissed in favor of Beatrice, Jan having turned down an offer of $20 million from Beatrice attorney Jerry Facher (Robert Duvall) while the jury was deliberating. The plaintiffs are forced to accept a settlement with Grace that barely covers the expense involved in trying the case, leaving Jan and his partners broke. The families are deeply disappointed, and Jan's partners dissolve their partnership, effectively breaking up the firm. Jan ends up alone, living in a small apartment and running a small-time law practice. He manages to find the last key witness to the case, but lacks resources and courage to appeal the judgement. The files are archived while Jan later files for bankruptcy.
In a postscript, a montage of short scenes involving the key characters in the film, combined with on-screen captions, reveals that the Environmental Protection Agency, building on Jan's work on the case, later brought its own enforcement action against the offending companies, forcing them to pay millions to clean up the land and the groundwater. It takes Jan several years to settle his debts, and he now practices environmental law in Toms River, New Jersey.
The plotline has been greatly simplified from the book, e.g. later findings by the Environmental Protection Agency and its potential consequences that might have allowed the plaintiffs another trial against Beatrice, and which did ultimately lead to a conviction of perjury against John Riley, and improper conduct for Mary Ryan, are referred to only briefly in the epilogue.
The characters Charles Nesson, Mark Phillips, Rikki Klieman, Teresa Padro and others have been removed from the film version, as well as the plot points that they contribute.",drama environmental toxin city woburn massachusetts contaminate area water supply link number death neighboring child jan schlichtmann john travolta cocky successful boston attorney zip town porsche small firm personal injury lawyer ask woburn resident anne anderson kathleen quinlan legal action responsible originally reject seemingly unprofitable case jan find major environmental issue involve groundwater contamination great legal potential couple defendant deep pocket local tannery responsible deadly case leukemia main employer area jan decide forward giant corporation real life company beatrice food grace company link tannery think case possibly earn million enhance firm considerable reputation bring class action lawsuit federal court jan represent family demand clean contaminate area apology case develop life take life jan firm lawyer tannery parent corporation easy intimidate judge john lithgow make key ruling plaintiff soon jan partner find position professional financial survival stake outcome case jan stubbornly decline settlement offer gradually come believe case money allow pride make outrageous demand decide win cost pressure toll jan partner go deeply debt lengthy trial case dismiss favor beatrice jan having turn offer million beatrice attorney jerry facher robert duvall jury deliberate plaintiff force accept settlement grace barely cover expense involve try case leave jan partner break family deeply disappointed jan partner dissolve partnership effectively break firm jan end live small apartment run small time law practice manage find key witness case lack resource courage appeal judgement file archive jan later file bankruptcy postscript montage short scene involve key character film combine screen caption reveal environmental protection agency build jan work case later bring enforcement action offend company force pay million clean land groundwater take jan year settle debt practice environmental law tom river new jersey plotline greatly simplify book later finding environmental protection agency potential consequence allow plaintiff trial beatrice ultimately lead conviction perjury john riley improper conduct mary ryan refer briefly epilogue character charle nesson mark phillips rikki klieman teresa padro remove film version plot point contribute
The Riddle of the Sands,adventure,"In the Spring of 1901, Carruthers, an aristocratic junior official in the British Foreign Office, is invited on a yachting and duck-shooting holiday by an old University acquaintance called Arthur Davies. On Carruthers' arrival on Germany's Northern coast to join the yacht Davies explains to him that he has a hidden agenda for the trip and the invitation beyond duck-hunting. While boating around the Frisian Islands ostensibly correcting antiquated British sea charts of the coastline's shifting topography, by chance he had met a retired German sailor by the name of Dollman and his family, including a daughter called Clara, with whom Davies has initiated a romantic attachment. He narrates further that whilst sailing together along the coast in a gale Dollman had, when Davies had tried to put into a particular estuary for shelter, inexplicably prevented him from entering by executing a deliberately hazardous sea-manoeuvre, to the degree that both their lives had been endangered by it. Davies then reveals to Carruthers that his real interest in the area is that he suspects that the Imperial German Navy is engaged in covert military activity of some nature in the Frisian Islands, with the intention of threatening the security of the North Sea from the British perspective, which the Royal Navy is strategically misdirected to meet, and this is why he has invited Carruthers' presence, given his ability to speak German and professional contacts within Whitehall, on a pre-text of a holiday.
Carruthers and Davies go on, amidst cryptic warnings-off from circling German naval officers, sailing expeditions among the Frisian isles and inlets, and fights, to carry out covert surveillance at the estuary in question, to discover that the II Reich is using a naval base hidden in the islands to carry out rehearsals for a seaborne passage across the North Sea of a German army with the aim of militarily invading England, and that Herr ""Dollman"" is in fact Lieutenant Thomas, an embittered former Royal Navy officer who is treasonously assisting their preparations with his detailed knowledge of England's coast and naval defences.

Suez,historical,"During a tennis match in Paris between Ferdinand de Lesseps (Tyrone Power) and his friend Vicomte Rene de Latour (Joseph Schildkraut), the enthusiastic admiration of Countess Eugenie de Montijo (Loretta Young) for de Lesseps attracts the attention of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (Leon Ames). Bonaparte sees to it that both she and de Lesseps are invited to his reception. At the party, a fortuneteller predicts that Eugenie will have a troubled life, but also wear a crown, and that de Lesseps will dig a ditch. Entranced by Eugenie's beauty, Bonaparte arranges for his romantic rival to be assigned to a diplomatic post in Egypt, joining his father, Count Mathieu de Lesseps (Henry Stephenson), the Consul-General. De Lesseps impulsively asks Eugenie to marry him immediately, but she turns him down.
In Egypt, de Lesseps befriends two people who will have a great influence on his life: Toni Pellerin (Annabella), a tomboy being raised by her grandfather, French Sergeant Pellerin (Sig Rumann); and Prince Said (J. Edward Bromberg), the indolent heir of his father, Mohammed Ali (Maurice Moskovitch), the Viceroy (ruler) of Egypt. Toni makes it clear that she has fallen in love with him, but de Lesseps still pines for Eugenie. Count de Lesseps leaves for France, leaving his son to take his place.
One day, after a brief rainstorm in the desert, de Lesseps sees the water draining into the sea and comes up with the idea for the Suez Canal. He departs for Paris to raise the necessary funding; Toni goes along as well. He presents his proposal to Bonaparte, but is rejected. He is also disheartened to learn that Eugenie is now very close to Bonaparte.
France is on the verge of civil war between Bonaparte and the French Assembly, led by Count de Lesseps and others. Eugenie persuades Ferdinand de Lesseps to pass along Bonaparte's proposal asking the Assembly to disband, giving Bonaparte's promise to reconvene it once the civil unrest has been defused. Despite their misgivings, the members of the Assembly agree, only to be betrayed and arrested. Bonaparte assumes the throne of the revived French Empire, just as Count de Lesseps had feared. The news causes the count to suffer a fatal stroke. Ferdinand de Lesseps is outraged, but Toni persuades him to do nothing. In return for de Lesseps' help, Bonaparte (now Emperor Napoleon III), withdraws his objections to the canal, and construction commences under de Lesseps' direction.
The building of the canal progresses despite Turkish sabotage. However, Napoleon unexpectedly withdraws his support out of political necessity; he needs to appease Great Britain, and the British Prime Minister (George Zucco) is firmly opposed to the project. Prince Said bankrupts himself to keep the venture going, but it is not enough. De Lesseps goes to England to plead his case. The Prime Minister is unmoved, but the leader of the opposition, Benjamin Disraeli (Miles Mander), is enthusiastic about the project. Disraeli tells him to return to Egypt and pray that Disraeli wins the upcoming general election. He does, and funding is assured.
As the canal nears completion, an enormous sandstorm threatens everything. When de Lesseps is knocked unconscious by flying debris, Toni rescues him by tying him to a wooden post, but is herself swept away and killed. De Lesseps finishes the canal and is honored by Eugenie, now Empress of France after her marriage to Napoleon III.[3]",historical tennis match paris ferdinand de lessep tyrone power friend vicomte rene de latour joseph schildkraut enthusiastic admiration countess eugenie de montijo loretta young de lessep attract attention louis napoléon bonaparte leon ames bonaparte see de lessep invite reception party fortuneteller predict eugenie troubled life wear crown de lessep dig ditch entrance eugenie beauty bonaparte arrange romantic rival assign diplomatic post egypt join father count mathieu de lesseps henry stephenson consul general de lesseps impulsively ask eugenie marry immediately turn egypt de lessep befriend people great influence life toni pellerin annabella tomboy raise grandfather french sergeant pellerin sig rumann prince say edward bromberg indolent heir father mohammed ali maurice moskovitch viceroy ruler egypt toni make clear fall love de lessep pine eugenie count de lessep leave france leave son place day brief rainstorm desert de lessep see water drain sea come idea suez canal depart paris raise necessary funding toni go present proposal bonaparte reject dishearten learn eugenie close bonaparte france verge civil war bonaparte french assembly lead count de lessep eugenie persuades ferdinand de lessep pass bonaparte proposal ask assembly disband give bonaparte promise reconvene civil unrest defuse despite misgiving member assembly agree betray arrest bonaparte assume throne revive french empire count de lessep fear news cause count suffer fatal stroke ferdinand de lesseps outraged toni persuade return de lessep help bonaparte emperor napoleon iii withdraw objection canal construction commence de lessep direction building canal progress despite turkish sabotage napoleon unexpectedly withdraw support political necessity need appease great britain british prime minister george zucco firmly opposed project prince say bankrupt venture go de lesseps go england plead case prime minister unmove leader opposition benjamin disraeli mile mander enthusiastic project disraeli tell return egypt pray disraeli win upcoming general election funding assure canal near completion enormous sandstorm threaten de lessep knock unconscious fly debris toni rescue tie wooden post sweep away kill de lesseps finish canal honor eugenie empress france marriage napoleon

Volanges confides in Merteuil that the arranged marriage required that Cécile be raised in a convent to ensure her chastity. Unaware that Merteuil is Gercourt's paramour, Volanges reveals that according to Gercourt, he is having trouble breaking off relations with his ""former"" mistress who is mentally unbalanced.
Angered over the loss of her lover and his slight of her character, Merteuil devises a devious plan of revenge. She approaches her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont (Colin Firth), and proposes that he seduce the virgin Cécile prior to her wedding night when Gercourt will learn he was ""not the first to arrive"". Valmont declines Merteuil's request. He is more interested in pursuing Madame de Tourvel (Meg Tilly), a beautiful married woman staying at his aunt's estate. When the subject of infidelity is introduced, Tourvel insists she would never be unfaithful to her husband who is in Rouen on business. Merteuil later mocks Valmont for his futile desire for Tourvel and makes him a wager: if Valmont succeeds in bedding Madame de Tourvel, he may also bed Merteuil; if he fails, he must consign himself to a monastery.
After learning that Cécile's music teacher, Danceny (Henry Thomas), has been writing love letters to Cécile, Merteuil gains the confidence of the young girl who confesses she loves Danceny. Merteuil then convinces her cousin to allow Cécile to join her in the country while helping Cécile write secret love letters to Danceny. Soon after, Merteuil and Cécile join Valmont at his aunt's country estate where Valmont flirts playfully with the innocent young girl. When Merteuil suggests that Valmont help Cécile write a love letter to Danceny, Valmont agrees and ends up taking Cécile's virginity. When Cécile confides in Merteuil about her experience with Valmont, Merteuil encourages the girl to marry Gercourt and keep Danceny as her lover.
Meanwhile, Valmont is unsuccessful in his numerous attempts at wooing Tourvel, who has been warned of his sexual scheming and debauchery. When Tourvel feels her defenses weakening and her attraction to Valmont growing, she flees to the city to get away from the temptation. After learning of her departure, Valmont rides to her residence and is there when she arrives. Surprised by Valmont's romantic actions and unable to resist her feelings for him, Tourvel finally returns his affections and they make love. In the morning, Tourvel says she has written her husband about her new love. She then leaves for the market to prepare a meal for her lover, but when she returns Valmont is gone.
Soon after, Valmont arrives at Merteuil's residence to collect his ""prize"" from her. When Merteuil initially refuses to honor her wager, and then offers herself in the wrong way, Valmont leaves in anger. He goes to Cécile and convinces her to write Danceny a letter explaining that Merteuil encouraged her to marry Gercourt and keep Danceny as her lover. Tourvel later comes to Valmont and spends the night, leaving before he wakes the next morning. Later, when Danceny reads Cécile's letter, he visits Merteuil and threatens her, demanding she send a letter to Cécile recommending that she call off her marriage. When Valmont arrives, he discovers that Merteuil has already seduced Danceny and revealed that Valmont took Cécile's virginity.
The next day, Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel set in the morning. That evening, Valmont prepares for the duel by drinking himself into a drunken stupor.

Nick's girlfriend is Kelly James, a health club instructor. Kelly wants to be married and have sex, and when a reluctant Nick introduces her to his mother, Mrs. Jargin wants nothing to do with him, blaming Nick for a racing accident that seriously injured her other son, Johnny.

Paathshaala,social,"The story begins with a new English teacher Rahul Udyavar (Shahid Kapoor) joining Saraswati Vidya Mandir school, in the Mirpurkhas suburbs. He strikes instant rapport with students and teachers alike.
When Rahul Udyavar unifies the teachers (Ayesha Takia and Sushant Singh) against the atrocities of the school's management, Principal Aditya Sahay (Nana Patekar) defends the management's decision.

The situation becomes graver as school management becomes overambitious with its growth and involves media planners in the extracurricular activities. This demands the involvement of students in TV reality shows and other media PR activities used for building the school's image in public which starts reflecting on the students' stress levels. The pressure on young minds increases incredibly, leading to unexpected and grim consequences.
Caught in the web of commercialization, the students go on strike unable to take the pressure, and it becomes a hectic situation.

Bhagam Bhag,"comedy, musical","Champak Chaturvedi (Paresh Rawal) the director of a theater group, is offered a chance to perform a show in London. Babla (Govinda) and Bunty (Akshay Kumar) are two derps and flirts in his group, always fighting with each other to get the role of the hero. Their behaviour causes the actress (Tanushree Dutta) to run away. This really upsets the organizer, who offered the chance mainly because of the heroine. After reaching London, Champak tells the duo that whoever gets a new actress will get to become hero. Then Babla asks Gulab Singh Lakhan Singh Haryanewale (Rajpal Yadav), a local driver where he can find a heroine. Gulab Singh misinterprets this as prostitute and directs him to a park.
Bunty, who has heard everything, follows them. In a misunderstanding, they meet two men from underworld and exchange their goods, only to find that the men have sold drugs to them since the underworld misinterpreted their need for heroine as ""heroin"". Bunty convinces Babla into going to the police to turn in the drugs to get good credit or an award, but the police get the wrong impression and think they are drug dealers. Commissioner JD Mehra (Jackie Shroff) releases them after telling them not to leave the country until they are proven innocent. Then while search of a heroine, Bunty and Gulab Singh take help of Guru (Shakti Kapoor), a local don who is a drunkard and they end up breaking his (Guru's) legs. Guru sends his goons to thrash Bunty and Gulab Singh but they escape. They bump into Munni (Lara Dutta), who is trying to commit suicide. Bunty saves her and brings her to the theatre group to be the heroine.
Later, Bunty falls in love with Munni, but then she has an accident. The doctor notes that she may have suicidal tendencies. When Munni wakes up, she claims to be Nisha Chauhan, wife of Vikram Chauhan (Arbaaz Khan). They meet Vikram, who confirms her suicidal nature. A heartbroken Bunty accepts the fact and tries to forget her, only to learn some time later that Nisha has burnt herself to death.
Meanwhile, the underworld don (Sharat Saxena) who gave drugs and his boss M.G. Gandhi (Manoj Joshi) think that Bunty, Babla and Champak are undercover cops and they want to kill them. However, Bunty suddenly spots Nisha in the city one day. Later, Champak and Babla too see her. On the day of the drama, the trio see Vikram flailing a gun at someone and are shocked to see him die in front of them.
All three are frightened and throw his body down a vent. During the performance, Vikram's body falls from the ceiling. Mehra questions everyone and arrests the trio for murder of Vikram. M.G. Gandhi wants the three dead because he thinks they're going to get him thrown in jail. Gandhi's men attack the police car transporting the trio, helping them to escape. The trio try to search priety based on the clues they have. Meanwhile, Gulab Singh is given task by Guru to search for the trio. M G Gandhi captures Champak. Bunty and Babla run into Nisha, well and alive, upon which they trap her at the clock tower of Brighton railway station.
It is revealed her real name is Aditi and she was hired by Vikram to play his wife Nisha and convince people she is crazy in return for money and a passport out of the UK. Vikram wanted to kill his real wife Nisha (Gurleen Chopra) to get her wealth. When Aditi found out about his ways, she tried to stop him and failed. She later tried to reach Bunty at the show to tell him about it, but Vikram caught her. Then Mehra arrived at the play and killed Vikram. Just then, Mehra arrives there and confirms that he is indeed Vikram's killer.
Mehra reveals that Nisha was his sister and he killed Vikram to avenge her murder. He also intends to kill Aditi as she helped Vikram to pass off Nisha's murder as suicide.The disaster is averted due to an accident.
Bunty tries to stop Mehra, saying that Aditi wanted to say something in her defense, but she remains tongue-tied due to fear. Guru and his men take Gulab Singh to the clock, leaving Hakka, Guru's right hand to take care of Ravinder Taneja, the sponsor. Hakka flees towards his master on spotting Gandhi and his men coming with Champak leaving Ravinder. Gandhi mistakes Ravinder as Sherkhan, a drug dealer from whom he used to buy drugs, ending up in annoying Ravinder. Meanwhile, Gulab Singh's employer (who had leased him a taxi) and Hakka, with his friends, enter the scene. Briefed wrongly due to misinterpreting by his men all those who were present as undercover cops, Gandhi fires his pistol towards the ceiling. All reach where Babla, Bunty, Mehra and Aditi stand. Gandhi, again due to incorrect briefing, fires at Mehra, but misses and the bullets pierce a beehive. The honeybees launch an attack, in standing against which everyone loses its head. Mehra flees the scene unhurt, and probably also calls the police.
Some climb on the top of the tower, while Bunty breaks the dial of the clock. All cling to the front of the clock while a firefighting crane arrives. The firefighter allows only two people, but everybody holds the crane, overloading and throwing it out of order. The victims are thrown off the crane seconds after they hold it. The first is an Arab(possibly Sherkhan in disguise); he runs head and feet first into a Time Magazine poster. A British drug dealer (who works for Gandhi) then crashes into a window of a nearby building. Bunty and Aditi then land on a hanging poster. Aditi is saved but Bunty falls down. Ravinder lands into the reservoir of a fountain, ingesting a marine animal on reaching underwater. Gulab Singh's employer, Hakka and Guru fall on a palm tree. Gandhi, his other man and Champak land on a live overhead electric line. Hakka drops down onto bouquets displayed under the tree. Guru, hanging on a rope or the line, transports in and disrupts the Pampered Pet Shop. Those on the line get thrown due to electric current. Gandhi lands in a firecracker store. His man falls into white paint. Gandhi emerges out tied to a rocket amidst deafening explosions. He, too, has a dive in the reservoir of a fountain. Champak slides down, ruining a set table. He is taken along by an oncoming Babla into a trashcan. The last to be thrown off the crane is Gulab Singh, who rests on the hands of a statue. The crane then falls apart. When in the hospital, Mehra returns the passports of Babla, Bunty and Champak. Then, he surrenders to his juniors.",comedy musical champak chaturvedi paresh rawal director theater group offer chance perform london babla govinda bunty akshay kumar derp flirt group fight role hero behaviour cause actress tanushree dutta run away upset organizer offer chance mainly heroine reach london champak tell duo get new actress hero babla ask gulab singh lakhan singh haryanewale rajpal yadav local driver find heroine gulab singh misinterpret prostitute direct park bunty hear follow misunderstanding meet man underworld exchange good find man sell drug underworld misinterpret need heroine heroin bunty convince babla go police turn drug good credit award police wrong impression think drug dealer commissioner jd mehra jackie shroff release tell leave country prove innocent search heroine bunty gulab singh help guru shakti kapoor local don drunkard end break guru leg guru send goon thrash bunty gulab singh escape bump munni lara dutta try commit suicide bunty save bring theatre group heroine later bunty fall love munni accident doctor note suicidal tendency munni wake claim nisha chauhan wife vikram chauhan arbaaz khan meet vikram confirm suicidal nature heartbroken bunty accept fact try forget learn time later nisha burn death underworld don sharat saxena give drug boss gandhi manoj joshi think bunty babla champak undercover cop want kill bunty suddenly spot nisha city day later champak babla day drama trio vikram flail gun shocked die frightened throw body vent performance vikram body fall ceiling mehra question arrest trio murder vikram gandhi want dead think go throw jail gandhi man attack police car transport trio help escape trio try search priety base clue gulab singh give task guru search trio m g gandhi capture champak bunty babla run nisha alive trap clock tower brighton railway station reveal real aditi hire vikram play wife nisha convince people crazy return money passport uk vikram want kill real wife nisha gurleen chopra wealth aditi find way try stop fail later try reach bunty tell vikram catch mehra arrive play kill vikram mehra arrive confirm vikram killer mehra reveal nisha sister kill vikram avenge murder intend kill aditi help vikram pass nisha murder disaster avert accident bunty try stop mehra say aditi want defense remain tongue tie fear guru man gulab singh clock leave hakka guru right hand care ravinder taneja sponsor hakka flee master spot gandhi man come champak leave ravinder gandhi mistake ravinder sherkhan drug dealer buy drug end annoying ravinder gulab singh employer lease taxi hakka friend enter scene brief wrongly misinterpret man present undercover cop gandhi fire pistol ceiling reach babla bunty mehra aditi stand gandhi incorrect briefing fire mehra miss bullet pierce beehive honeybee launch attack stand lose head mehra flee scene unhurt probably call police climb tower bunty break dial clock cle clock firefighte crane arrive firefighter allow people everybody hold crane overload throw order victim throw crane second hold sherkhan disguise run head foot time magazine poster british drug dealer work gandhi crash window nearby building bunty aditi land hang poster aditi save bunty fall ravinder land reservoir fountain ingest marine animal reach underwater gulab singh employer hakka guru fall palm tree gandhi man champak land live overhead electric line hakka drop bouquet display tree guru hang rope line transport disrupt pampered pet shop line throw electric current gandhi land firecracker store man fall white paint gandhi emerge tie rocket amidst deafen explosion dive reservoir fountain champak slide ruin set table take oncoming babla trashcan throw crane gulab singh rest hand statue crane fall apart hospital mehra return passport babla bunty champak surrender junior

It is whilst doing her office cleaning that she retrieves a cigar discarded by financier James Ryder (Harry H. Corbett) as a gift for the Colonel, wrapping it in a scrap of paper. The Colonel discovers that the scrap of paper is actually a telegram containing details about a City takeover bid that has fallen through. He unscrupulously uses this insider information to make £5000 on the stock exchange, which he offers to share equally with Mrs. Cragg.
Though she does not understand what happened, she is convinced that he has done something wrong, so she goes to inform Ryder. However, before she can, she hears him on the telephone talking about his plan to demolish Pitt Street, evicting her and all her friends, so he can erect an office building. She argues with him, to no avail. He tells her, ""If you want anything, you've got to go out and get it ... so long as it's legal."" She takes his advice to heart.

Freaky Friday,comedy,"Ellen Andrews (Barbara Harris) and her daughter, Annabel Andrews (Jodie Foster) constantly quarrel. Following a disagreement on Friday the 13th, Annabel leaves to join a friend at a local diner. In sync, Annabel and Ellen (who is in the family home's kitchen) both wish aloud, ""I wish I could switch places with her for just one day"". Their wish comes true when they switch their bodies and subsequently lives.
Ellen and Annabel continue to live their everyday lives as each other. Annabel, as Ellen, remains at home, tending to laundry, car repair, grocery deliveries, carpet cleaners, dry cleaners, her housemaid, and the family Basset Hound, Max. As though Annabel did not have her hands full, Bill Andrews (John Astin) coerces her to cook dinner for twenty-five as his catered dinner party plans fell through. Annabel enlists Boris, a neighbor whom she has harbored a crush, to look after her younger brother and help make a chocolate mousse but all three manage to mess everything up, then later saving face by making everything into a smorgasbord. Annabel does have a bright spot with her brother, Ben, such as getting to have personal discussions with him, when she picks him up from school. He tells her which qualities he envies about Annabel, and is able to share her loathing over the housemaid, who is constantly complaining about Annabel's sloppiness, and then confesses when he tried to be messy to connect with Annabel, the housemaid said he didn't know better and cleaned up after him. Plus, between all the talks, they play baseball which adds to their affection. These combined situations lead to Annabel's remorse for misjudging Ben and getting a different outlook on him.
Meanwhile Ellen attends school as Annabel where she struggles with marching band, destroys her entire typing class's electric typewriters, exposes her photography class's developing film, and leads the school's field hockey team to a loss. However, Ellen does have one bright point, in a US history class where she accurately recounts the Korean War, having lived through the 1950s as a little girl. In an effort to escape school, Ellen (as Annabel) runs to Bill's office. There, she encounters Bill's new attractive, young, and immodestly dressed secretary. Ellen attempts to intimidate the young woman by sharing how frightening ""her mother"" is. This effort appeared successful as the secretary adopts more modest clothing, glasses, and an unflattering hairstyle. Ellen (as Annabel) asks Bill for access to his credit card in order to make herself over as her braces were scheduled to be removed that afternoon. Bill approves, and chalks up his secretary's awkward appearance to personal problems at home as her son is ill and her husband is unemployed, causing Ellen to scold herself for not trusting her husband.
The day ends in a comical twist when the mother-daughter pair wishing a new request: to return to themselves. This does happen, although in a different manner than before: they are physically transferred, with Annabel suddenly sitting now behind the wheel of a car with Ben and Boris, with none of them knowing how to drive and attracting the attention of several squad cars. Ellen in turn finds herself water skiing as she (as Annabel) was scheduled to participate in an aquacade. Bill, who has prospective clients at the aquacade, fears unemployment as he sees Ellen flailing helplessly on skis, but her antics amuse the clients so much that Bill wins the account.
With a new understanding of each other's lives, mother and daughter forgive each other. Following the events of Freaky Friday, Annabel begins dating Boris. Bill is playing cards with Ellen, still trying to understand what happened. Ellen and Bill are fine with Boris taking Annabel to a pizzeria for a date, and Annabel surprises Ben by letting him tag along with them.

Zheng makes a proposition to Chen to remedy this and proposes that Chen open up a school with his help in Tianjin if Chen is willing to teach his secrets.
Chen declines this offer and chooses to open a school anyway, to enhance his personal reputation. Chen cites a rule that allows him to open a school if he defeats eight of the Tianjin schools. Zheng warns Chen that if he chooses this route, he will be expelled. Zheng proposes that Chen train a local disciple who will defeat the eight schools. Chen says this will take three years, but Zheng tells him he has no choice. Zheng tells Chen he already has a candidate for Chen's disciple.
Chen decides he needs to marry a local woman and proposes marriage to the waitress at the restaurant he is at. The waitress, Zhao, is a pariah because she had a child with a foreigner when she was 17. Zhao laughs at his proposal, but this is remedied by Zheng's later intervention. Chen and Zhao's arrangement is that the two maintain appearances as a poor couple. She is to never ask him what he is doing in Tianjin, and he will take her shopping and bring her crab for dinner. Despite the sham marriage, the two of them have a continued physical (sexual) relationship.
One day Chen and Zhao are beset by thugs, who Chen easily dispatches. This catches the attention of Geng, a local rickshaw coolie. Geng pays a visit to Chen and Zhao's residence - mostly to look at how beautiful Zhao is. He challenges Chen to a duel. Chen soundly defeats Geng but decides to accept him as a disciple.
Chen then tells Zheng that he has a new disciple and that the disciple Zheng had originally picked out for him, Duan Rui, is no longer needed. Zheng then reveals his design to Chen. After the disciple defeats the eight schools, Zheng will defeat the disciple, and this will further enhance his reputation in the Martial Arts world. The consequence from this is that the disciple will have to be cast out from Tianjin. Chen says that Geng is a nobody and doesn't pay a second thought that he will be cast out.
Geng turns out to be prodigy in Wing Chun and helps Chen attain the victories he needs well ahead of schedule. However, this draws the ire of Madame Zou, who visits Chen with her thugs to find out what his intentions are. Chen disavows Geng's victories, and Madame Zou decides to let him live on that basis. Zhao then realizes what Chen's ambitions are and that he intends to betray Geng. Chen angrily casts Zhao out.
Zheng is visited by a former student, Lin Xiwen, who is now an officer in the military. Lin tells Zheng he arranged a meeting for him with the Viceroy, but when Zheng attends the meeting, he is told that the Viceroy will not be attending. Instead they are to film a demonstration for the Viceroy. Zheng thoroughly defeats Lin in sparring. However, Lin ambushes Zheng using his weapon, and Lin is filmed defeating an injured Zheng. Madame Zou reveals that this was all her design to reestablish herself as the grandmaster. Zheng only became grandmaster after the death of Madame Zou's husband.
Zheng decides to leave for Brazil and refuses to fight Geng. Chen realizes his dream will likely not be achieved. Madama Zou invites Chen to tea and tells Chen that Geng will be considered an enemy. Chen offers that both he and Geng will leave Tianjin if Geng is not harmed. Madame Zou decides that both of them leaving will be seen by the world as the Tianjin Martial Arts community acting as a bully. She allows Chen to have his Wing Chun school for only one year after which Chen is to leave Tianjin.
Geng is attacked and defeats all of the thugs hired to attack him. Lin challenges Geng to a duel with knives but stabs him in the abdomen before Geng can even draw his knife. Lin offers to allow Geng to live, but Geng would have to leave Tianjin and never return. Geng is driven to the countryside and left there. Geng remains stubborn and rather than get medical attention, stumbles back to town and dies from blood loss.
On the day Chen is to open his school, Chen visits with the Tea Girl, who tells him about her friend Geng, who was famous for defeating the eight schools. She presents Chen (at his bequest) one of Geng's books which has Geng's blood stains inside the pages. Chen is visibly moved by this. In the opening ceremony for Chen's school, Madame Zou plays the film in which Zheng was defeated by Lin. Zou says Lin, the student, has overtaken his master and proclaims Lin the new grandmaster. Chen then challenges Lin and attacks him with a spear. Madame Zou blocks the attack and is stabbed in the chest. The film resumes and Chen is jumped by Madame Zou's thugs and held down. During this struggle one of Madame's Zou's thugs slits Lin's throat. Zou blames Chen for Lin's death and tells him he will not be allowed to live. Chen offers to share his secrets and train students for Madame Zou in exchange for his life. While getting ready for a demonstration, Chen makes an escape. The entire Tianjin martial arts community - all 19 schools - goes after him.
Chen is trapped in a narrow alleyway. The masters of each of the schools challenge him, and he defeats every one of them. The final obstacle is Madame Zou, and instead of harming her, Chen only cuts off her earring.
Chen then goes to the train station and does not see Zhao there. He assumes she has already left and he boards a train for Guangdong. Zhao meanwhile was waiting for him in a bakery, just outside of the building where the opening ceremony was. She had prayed for Chen and was afraid the prayers would not work if she was too far away. She goes to the train station after Chen has left. She is confronted by Madame Zou and her people. Zou asks her if she knows what Chen has done. Zhao replies that she is ready to take responsibility for her husband. Madame Zou decides to leave Zhao alone, but leaves a spy to follow Zhao in order to deliver a message to Chen that he is to keep silent about what happened.
The film ends with Chen on the train looking into Geng's blood-stained book.",drama action martial art story follow journey wing chun grandmaster chen surviving practitioner attempt open martial art school tianjin city know martial art culture intertwine chen ambition madame zou design take control martial art community tianjin film open geng liangchen chen shi apprentice thoroughly humiliate madame zou champion duel film cut time chen shi arrival tianjin chen defeat grandmaster zheng disciple zheng grandmaster tianjin martial art community zheng impress chen learn chen practice wing chun little know southern style time lament fact true secret martial art teach widely master restrict pass art student lifetime zheng make proposition chen remedy propose chen open school help tianjin chen willing teach secret chen decline offer choose open school enhance personal reputation chen cite rule allow open school defeat tianjin schools zheng warn chen choose route expel zheng propose chen train local disciple defeat school chen say year zheng tell choice zheng tell chen candidate chen disciple chen decide need marry local woman propose marriage waitress restaurant waitress zhao pariah child foreigner zhao laugh proposal remedie zheng later intervention chen zhao arrangement maintain appearance poor couple ask tianjin shopping bring crab dinner despite sham marriage continue physical sexual relationship day chen zhao beset thug chen easily dispatch catch attention geng local rickshaw coolie geng pay visit chen zhao residence look beautiful zhao challenge chen duel chen soundly defeat geng decide accept disciple chen tell zheng new disciple disciple zheng originally pick duan rui long need zheng reveal design chen disciple defeat school zheng defeat disciple enhance reputation martial art world consequence disciple cast tianjin chen say geng pay second thought cast geng turn prodigy wing chun help chen attain victory need ahead schedule draw ire madame zou visit chen thug find intention chen disavow geng victory madame zou decide let live basis zhao realize chen ambition intend betray geng chen angrily cast zhao zheng visit student lin xiwen officer military lin tell zheng arrange meeting viceroy zheng attend meeting tell viceroy attend instead film demonstration viceroy zheng thoroughly defeat lin spar lin ambush zheng weapon lin film defeat injure zheng madame zou reveal design reestablish grandmaster zheng grandmaster death madame zou husband zheng decide leave brazil refuse fight geng chen realize dream likely achieve madama zou invite chen tea tell chen geng consider enemy chen offer geng leave tianjin geng harm madame zou decide leave see world tianjin martial art community act bully allow chen wing chun school year chen leave tianjin geng attack defeat thug hire attack lin challenge geng duel knife stab abdomen geng draw knife lin offer allow geng live geng leave tianjin return geng drive countryside leave geng remain stubborn medical attention stumble town die blood loss day chen open school chen visit tea girl tell friend geng famous defeat school present chen bequest geng book geng blood stain inside page chen visibly move opening ceremony chen school madame zou play film zheng defeat lin zou say lin student overtake master proclaim lin new grandmaster chen challenge lin attack spear madame zou block attack stab chest film resume chen jump madame zou thug hold struggle madame zou thug slit lin throat zou blame chen lin death tell allow live chen offer share secret train student madame zou exchange life get ready demonstration chen make escape entire tianjin martial art community school go chen trap narrow alleyway master school challenge defeat final obstacle madame zou instead harm chen cut earring chen go train station zhao assume leave board train guangdong zhao wait bakery outside building opening ceremony pray chen afraid prayer work far away go train station chen leave confront madame zou people zou ask know chen zhao reply ready responsibility husband madame zou decide leave zhao leave spy follow zhao order deliver message chen silent happen film end chen train look geng blood stain book
The Black Shield of Falworth,adventure,"Myles Falworth (Tony Curtis) and his sister Meg (Barbara Rush) live in obscurity on a farm in Crosbey-Dale with their guardian Diccon Bowman (Rhys Williams). This is to protect them from the attainder placed upon their family by King Henry IV of England (Ian Keith) because their father has been (falsely) accused of treason and murdered by the Earl of Alban (David Farrar). When a hunting party comprising the Earl of Alban, the lord of Crosbey-Dale, and another nobleman, Sir Robert, stop at their farm for refreshment, they are repulsed by Myles to stop them molesting his sister.
This confrontation accelerates Diccon's plans to send them to Mackworth Castle in Derbyshire (based on the eponymous castle). The Earl of Mackworth (Herbert Marshall), a close friend of their father, becomes their protector, and he sees in Myles the man who can rid England of the evil machinations of the Earl of Alban. Myles is trained to be a knight, is knighted by the king, and kills the Earl of Alban in trial by combat, foiling Alban's attempt to seize the English crown. Myles then marries the Earl of Mackworth's daughter, Lady Anne (Janet Leigh).",adventure myle falworth tony curtis sister meg barbara rush live obscurity farm crosbey dale guardian diccon bowman rhy williams protect attainder place family king henry iv england ian keith father falsely accuse treason murder earl alban david farrar hunting party comprise earl alban lord crosbey dale nobleman sir robert stop farm refreshment repulse myle stop molest sister confrontation accelerate diccon plan send mackworth castle derbyshire base eponymous castle earl mackworth herbert marshall close friend father protector see myle man rid england evil machination earl alban myle train knight knight king kill earl alban trial combat foil alban attempt seize english crown myle marry earl mackworth daughter lady anne janet leigh
Office Killer,comedy,"A magazine editor named Dorine, due to budget cuts, is forced to work from home. One night she is called to help fix the computer of a co-worker, Gary Michaels, who is electrocuted while trying to fix the wires. Dorine dials 911, but hangs up when the call is answered. She places the corpse on a cart, rolls it down to her car, loads it in her trunk, and takes it home, placing it in her basement. Then, seemingly without reason, she goes into a murder spree. She begins her spree by murdering another office worker, but later murders two young Girl Scouts who arrive at her door to sell cookies. The young girls join the other corpses in the basement, and Dorine is seen eating the cookies while working on her new laptop. Dorine sends messages from Gary to the remaining office workers, implying he is alive. There are three more murders before the movie ends, all artistically executed. The last murder is the office manager (played by a young Jeanne Tripplehorn), who awakens in the basement, surrounded by dismembered bodies, after being knocked out by Dorine on a lunch date. After dispatching the office manager's boyfriend, who had come searching for her (a young Michael Imperioli) with a kitchen knife, Dorine murders the office manager after taunting her for making her and other employees work from home. The last scene shows Dorine, after her mother's death, setting fire to her basement, then, sporting a blond wig and makeup and with the office manager's head in a bag on the seat beside her, driving away in her car, and circling a newspaper ad with her pencil for an office job.",comedy magazine editor name dorine budget cut force work home night call help fix computer co worker gary michaels electrocute try fix wire dorine dial hang answer place corpse cart roll car load trunk take home place basement seemingly reason go murder spree begin spree murder office worker later murder young girl scout arrive door sell cookie young girl join corpse basement dorine see eat cookie work new laptop dorine send message gary remain office worker imply alive murder movie end artistically execute murder office manager play young jeanne tripplehorn awaken basement surround dismembered body knock dorine lunch date dispatch office manager boyfriend come search young michael imperioli kitchen knife dorine murder office manager taunt make employee work home scene show dorine mother death set fire basement sport blond wig makeup office manager head bag seat drive away car circle newspaper ad pencil office job
Species II,science fiction,"Three years after the events of the previous film, Commander Patrick Ross leads a manned mission to Mars. Soil samples collected by Patrick's team of astronauts unwittingly contain an extraterrestrial substance which thaws aboard their capsule due to the temperature difference and contaminates them, causing a seven-minute contact gap with mission control. With seemingly no subsequent negative effects, the astronauts return to Earth to public celebration. Only an institutionalized former scientist, Dr. Cromwell, reacts to their return with violent panic. Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Baker has created a clone of Sil named Eve, whose alien DNA is suppressed to make her more docile. Her team conducts experiments on Eve, hoping to find a way to combat the alien species should it ever return to Earth. Every experiment is unsuccessful as Eve's biology adapts.
Upon their return, Patrick and his team are told to refrain from sexual activity for ten days. Patrick disregards this advice and has a threesome with two sisters following a fundraiser. During sex with the second woman, he begins to sprout tentacles. The lady notices his transformation while she is stroking his body and is horrified at the sight of him whereupon she tries to free herself from his clutches. Both mothers experience accelerated pregnancies, culminating when Patrick's half-alien children violently explode from their abdomens. Patrick hides both corpses and his rapidly growing sons on the property of his father, U.S. Senator Judson Ross. The next day, Patrick tells his father he cannot remember the previous night's events. Senator Ross indicates that he is aware of Patrick's behavior and tells him to focus on his political goals.
Dr. Orinsky, one of the NASA scientists who examined Patrick, discovers something amiss about his blood sample and desperately tries to contact Cromwell. However, Orinsky is ambushed and disemboweled by an alien Patrick, who snuck into the labs. Laura discovers that the DNA in Orinsky's wounds is distinct from Eve's, prompting Colonel Burgess, the military supervisor in charge of her project, to reunite her with Press Lennox to contain the new threat. Press and Laura seek out Cromwell, Orinsky's former professor, and learn that he discovered that the alien species had attacked and destroyed Mars in ancient times. Because of his fears that alien DNA might remain on Mars to infect anyone who visited the planet in the future, Cromwell urged the government to abort the mission, but was institutionalized to permanently silence him.
Press and Laura report their findings to Burgess, identifying the Mars astronauts as the prime suspects. Unable to find Patrick, they pursue the other astronauts, Anne Sampas and Dennis Gamble. They arrive too late to prevent Anne from having sex with her husband, resulting in her impregnation with hybrid offspring. The tentacle-like creature bursts from Anne's abdomen and kills her husband before Press and Laura manage to kill it while Anne dies of her injuries. Meanwhile, a second team of government agents locate and examine the third astronaut, Dennis Gamble, but confirm he is not infected. Laura discovers that Anne's hybrid DNA does not match that in Orinsky's wounds, meaning Patrick is the killer. Meanwhile, Patrick has sex with his fiancée, resulting in her death and the birth of another hybrid son. Horrified at causing the woman's death, Patrick attempts suicide by shotgun, but the alien DNA regenerates his head and restores him back to life—with the drive to mate with as many women as possible. Dennis witnesses this and tells Press and Laura what he saw, remembers what happened in the capsule and joining them in their mission. Patrick begins impregnating as many women as he can, hiding his victims and up to twenty children at the shed.
Laura is ordered to activate Eve's alien DNA so she can telepathically track Patrick, but this makes her volatile and strengthens her alien instincts. Patrick surrenders to Press and Dennis after attempting to rape a woman at a parking lot of a supermarket, whereupon Patrick becomes aware of Eve; they take him to the lab despite dubious of his submission. As Patrick is taken to custody, Eve shows signs of being in heat. He demands Laura open Eve's cell and nearly kills her when she refuses, but Press and Dennis drive him off with a special gaseous weapon. Burgess confronts Senator Ross with proof of Patrick's infection and demands help in detaining Patrick. Suspicious that Patrick will instead be killed, Ross deduces that he is at the shed and apologizes for treating his son so coldly. Patrick's human side briefly returns, but while he tearfully embraces his father, the alien DNA violently reasserts itself and kills the Senator. Ross's death completely destroys Patrick's humanity, and he helps his hybrid children to cocoon, so they will soon mature and begin mating themselves, preparing them to eradicate humanity.
Back at the lab, Laura discovers Dennis was not infected because he is a carrier of sickle-cell disease, as the species lacks immunity to human genetic diseases. While they plan to weaponise this weakness, Eve breaks out of her confinement to find Patrick. Press, Laura and Dennis pursue her, with Burgess and the military following. At the shed, they kill Patrick's offspring while Eve and Patrick transform into their alien forms and begin to mate. The mating stops when Press and Dennis intervene, allowing Eve to break free; Patrick overpowers Eve by performing fellatio, apparently killing her. Press impales him in the back with a pitchfork coated in Dennis' blood, causing Patrick to disintegrate and die.
The military escorts Press, Laura and the injured Dennis away. Eve's lifeless body is loaded into an ambulance, but shortly after, her womb begins to swell rapidly—indicating her survival and impregnation by Patrick—while one of his youngest sons, who somehow survived, watches. As the screen cuts to black, Eve's uterus bursts and her screaming is heard.",science fiction year event previous film commander patrick ross lead manned mission mar soil sample collect patrick team astronaut unwittingly contain extraterrestrial substance thaw aboard capsule temperature difference contaminate cause seven minute contact gap mission control seemingly subsequent negative effect astronaut return earth public celebration institutionalized scientist dr cromwell react return violent panic dr laura baker create clone sil name eve alien dna suppress docile team conduct experiment eve hope find way combat alien specie return earth experiment unsuccessful eve biology adapt return patrick team tell refrain sexual activity day patrick disregard advice threesome sister follow fundraiser sex second woman begin sprout tentacle lady notice transformation stroke body horrify sight try free clutch mother experience accelerated pregnancy culminate patrick half alien child violently explode abdomen patrick hide corpse rapidly grow son property father senator judson ross day patrick tell father remember previous night event senator ross indicate aware patrick behavior tell focus political goal dr orinsky nasa scientist examine patrick discover amiss blood sample desperately try contact cromwell orinsky ambush disembowel alien patrick snuck lab laura discover dna orinsky wound distinct eve prompt colonel burgess military supervisor charge project reunite press lennox contain new threat press laura seek cromwell orinsky professor learn discover alien specie attack destroy mar ancient time fear alien dna remain mar infect visit planet future cromwell urge government abort mission institutionalize permanently silence press laura report finding burgess identify mar astronaut prime suspect unable find patrick pursue astronaut anne sampas dennis gamble arrive late prevent anne have sex husband result impregnation hybrid offspring tentacle like creature burst anne abdomen kill husband press laura manage kill anne die injury second team government agent locate examine astronaut dennis gamble confirm infect laura discover anne hybrid dna match orinsky wound mean patrick killer patrick sex fiancée result death birth hybrid son horrify cause woman death patrick attempt suicide shotgun alien dna regenerate head restore life drive mate woman possible dennis witness tell press laura see remember happen capsule join mission patrick begin impregnate woman hide victim child shed laura order activate eve alien dna telepathically track patrick make volatile strengthen alien instinct patrick surrender press dennis attempt rape woman parking lot supermarket patrick aware eve lab despite dubious submission patrick take custody eve show sign heat demand laura open eve cell nearly kill refuse press dennis drive special gaseous weapon burgess confront senator ross proof patrick infection demand help detain patrick suspicious patrick instead kill ross deduce shed apologize treat son coldly patrick human briefly return tearfully embrace father alien dna violently reassert kill senator ross death completely destroy patrick humanity help hybrid child cocoon soon mature begin mate prepare eradicate humanity lab laura discover dennis infect carrier sickle cell disease species lack immunity human genetic disease plan weaponise weakness eve break confinement find patrick press laura dennis pursue burgess military following shed kill patrick offspring eve patrick transform alien form begin mate mating stop press dennis intervene allow eve break free patrick overpower eve perform fellatio apparently kill press impale pitchfork coat dennis blood cause patrick disintegrate die military escort press laura injure denni away eve lifeless body load ambulance shortly womb begin swell rapidly indicate survival impregnation patrick young son survive watch screen cut black eve uterus burst scream hear

The Abominable Snowman,horror,"Dr. John Rollason (Peter Cushing), his wife, Helen (Maureen Connell), and assistant, Peter Fox (Richard Wattis), are guests of the Lama (Arnold Marlé) of the monastery of Rong-buk while on a botanical expedition to the Himalayas. A second expedition, led by Dr. Tom Friend (Forrest Tucker) accompanied by trapper Ed Shelley (Robert Brown), photographer Andrew McNee (Michael Brill) and Sherpa guide Kusang (Wolfe Morris), arrives at the monastery in search of the legendary Yeti or Abominable Snowman. Rollason, despite the objections of his wife and the Lama, decides to join Friend's expedition. Whereas Rollason is motivated by scientific curiosity to learn more about the creature, Friend seeks fame and fortune and wants to capture a live Yeti and present it to the world's press.
The expedition climbs high into the mountains and finds a set of giant footprints in the snow, evidence of the Yeti's existence. As the tensions between Rollason and Friend rise, McNee is injured by a bear trap laid by Friend to catch the Yeti and later dies in a fall. Kusang flees back to the monastery from where Helen and Fox decide to mount a rescue mission. Meanwhile, Shelley succeeds in shooting and killing a Yeti, an act that enrages the creature's fellows. When Shelley is killed in a failed attempt to catch a live specimen, Friend finally decides to cut his losses and leave with the body of the dead Yeti. However, the Yeti close in on the two survivors and Friend is killed in an avalanche.
Rollason takes refuge in an ice cave and watches in amazement as a number of Yeti arrive and take away the body of their fallen compatriot. He realises the Yeti are an intelligent species biding their time to claim the Earth when humanity has destroyed itself.
The rescue party finds Rollason and brings him back to the monastery where, when questioned by the Lama, he claims the expedition found nothing (apparently the result of telepathic hypnosis by the Yetis).",horror dr john rollason peter cushing wife helen maureen connell assistant peter fox richard wattis guest lama arnold marlé monastery rong buk botanical expedition himalayas second expedition lead dr tom friend forr tucker accompany trapper ed shelley robert brown photographer andrew mcnee michael brill sherpa guide kusang wolfe morris arrive monastery search legendary yeti abominable snowman rollason despite objection wife lama decide join friend expedition rollason motivate scientific curiosity learn creature friend seek fame fortune want capture live yeti present world press expedition climb high mountain find set giant footprint snow evidence yeti existence tension rollason friend rise mcnee injure bear trap lay friend catch yeti later die fall kusang flee monastery helen fox decide mount rescue mission shelley succeed shoot kill yeti act enrage creature fellow shelley kill fail attempt catch live speciman friend finally decide cut loss leave body dead yeti yeti close survivor friend kill avalanche rollason take refuge ice cave watch amazement number yeti arrive away body fall compatriot realise yeti intelligent specie bide time claim earth humanity destroy rescue party find rollason bring monastery question lama claim expedition find apparently result telepathic hypnosis yetis
Daybreakers,horror,"In 2019, a plague has transformed most of the world's population into vampires. The human population has plummeted and the need for blood becomes desperate. Vampires deprived of blood for long durations degenerate into ""subsiders,"" psychotic bat-like creatures with no memories of who they were and whose only thought is the craving for blood. The few remaining humans are captured and harvested in laboratory farms while scientists research a synthetic blood substitute.
Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is the head hematologist for the largest supplier of human blood in the US, owned by Charles Bromley (Sam Neill). Edward and colleague Christopher Caruso (Vince Colosimo) are developing a blood substitute.
Driving home from a failed experiment, Dalton accidentally runs another vehicle off the road. Checking on the occupants of the other vehicle, he learns they are humans. With the police approaching, Dalton has them hide in his vehicle. They part ways, but not before their leader, Audrey (Claudia Karvan), learns Edward's name and occupation from the ID badge on his jacket.
At home, Edward is surprised by his estranged brother Frankie (Michael Dorman). Frankie's gift of a bottle of pure human blood re-ignites a long-standing argument over Edward's sympathies towards humans. The argument is cut short when a subsider invades Edward's house, forcing the brothers to kill it.
The next morning, Audrey visits Edward's home and hands him a note with instructions for a meeting. During the meeting, Edward is introduced to Lionel ""Elvis"" Cormac (Willem Dafoe), a human who was once a vampire. Before he can say how he reverted to human, a military team arrives with Frankie, who had followed Edward and intends to capture both Cormac and Audrey. Audrey manages to knock Frankie unconscious and the three flee. Once they escape, Cormac explains that he was cured of vampirism when he was ejected from his sun-proof vehicle by a crash. Exposed to the sun, Elvis burst into flames, but his life was saved when he landed in a river, having been exposed to the sun for a precise length of time to turn him human again. Edward agrees to help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure.
That night Edward meets more human survivors, as well as Senator Turner (Jay Laga'aia), a vampire who is secretly helping the colony develop a cure. A convoy of humans heading to Audrey's group is ambushed and captured. The soldiers track the position of the vineyard, forcing Turner and the humans to flee. Audrey, Cormac and Edward stay behind so Edward can be cured. Edward is able to recreate the cure Elvis had explained, curing himself of vampirism. They attempt to regroup with Turner and the other humans, only to find they are all dead.
One of the captured convoy, Alison (Isabel Lucas), is revealed to be Charles' human daughter. Charles has Frankie forcibly turn her into a vampire. She refuses to drink human blood, and turns into a subsider. She is rounded up with others and dragged into sunlight to burn to death. Witnessing Alison's death upsets Frankie, causing him to seek out his brother. Meanwhile the military imposes martial law to control the subsider population and preserve order.
Edward, Cormac and Audrey break into Christopher's home and ask him to help spread the cure. However, Christopher has finally discovered a viable blood substitute and is not interested in a cure. He summons soldiers who capture Audrey while Cormac and Edward escape. They are found by Frankie, who agrees to help. He attacks Cormac, but drinking his blood turns Frankie human again; revealing that the risky sunlight cure is unnecessary.
Edward, trying to save Audrey, turns himself in to Charles, who gloats about his new monopoly of the blood substitute. Edward taunts Charles into biting him, making him human again like Frankie.
Edward leaves Charles at the mercy of soldiers who are on the brink of becoming subsiders. Frankie arrives and, surrounded by soldiers, draws their attention to himself to allow Edward and Audrey to escape; a feeding frenzy results, as the hungry soldiers consume first Frankie's blood and then that of the soldiers cured by it, until at last only three soldiers are left standing, cured and bewildered. Christopher, to cover up the cure, shoots the three and is about to shoot Edward and Audrey when Cormac kills him with a crossbow.
The three survivors drive off into the sunrise. In a voice-over, Edward addresses the general population, announcing the cure.",horror plague transform world population vampire human population plummet need blood desperate vampire deprive blood long duration degenerate subsider psychotic bat like creature memory thought craving blood remain human capture harvest laboratory farm scientist research synthetic blood substitute edward dalton ethan hawke head hematologist large supplier human blood own charles bromley sam neill edward colleague christopher caruso vince colosimo develop blood substitute drive home fail experiment dalton accidentally run vehicle road check occupant vehicle learn human police approach dalton hide vehicle way leader audrey claudia karvan learn edward occupation d badge jacket home edward surprise estranged brother frankie michael dorman frankie gift bottle pure human blood ignite long stand argument edward sympathy human argument cut short subsider invade edward house force brother kill morning audrey visit edward home hand note instruction meeting meeting edward introduce lionel elvis cormac willem dafoe human vampire revert human military team arrive frankie follow edward intend capture cormac audrey audrey manage knock frankie unconscious flee escape cormac explain cure vampirism eject sun proof vehicle crash expose sun elvis burst flame life save land river having expose sun precise length time turn human edward agree help cormac find way recreate cure night edward meet human survivor senator turner jay vampire secretly help colony develop cure convoy human head audrey group ambush capture soldier track position vineyard force turner human flee audrey cormac edward stay edward cure edward able recreate cure elvis explain cure vampirism attempt regroup turner human find dead capture convoy alison isabel lucas reveal charle human daughter charles frankie forcibly turn vampire refuse drink human blood turn subsider round drag sunlight burn death witness alison death upset frankie cause seek brother military impose martial law control subsider population preserve order edward cormac audrey break christopher home ask help spread cure christopher finally discover viable blood substitute interested cure summon soldier capture audrey cormac edward escape find frankie agree help attack cormac drink blood turn frankie human reveal risky sunlight cure unnecessary edward try save audrey turn charle gloat new monopoly blood substitute edward taunts charles bite make human like frankie edward leave charle mercy soldier brink subsider frankie arrive surround soldier draw attention allow edward audrey escape feeding frenzy result hungry soldier consume frankie blood soldier cure soldier leave stand cure bewildered christopher cover cure shoot shoot edward audrey cormac kill crossbow survivor drive sunrise voice edward address general population announce cure

Cornered, they arrive at the San Francisco docks, where they convince the captain of a small cargo ship, Sam McVeigh (Louis Wolheim), to take them aboard on his run to Mexico, mostly because he is enchanted with Kitty. Marsden is posing as a minister. As the ship sets sail, every sailor aboard lusts after Kitty, none more so than the captain. One night, when inebriated, he corners Kitty in his cabin and begins to force himself on her. She stops him by basically telling him that he is better than that, which makes him do some deep soul-searching. During the rest of the voyage, Kitty manages to fend off the rest of the crew, with the help of the disarmed captain.
By the time they dock in Mexico, McVeigh has fallen in love with Kitty, who he still believes to be the wife of ""Minister"" Marsden.

He returns to Salem's Lot, the town of his birth, to find that it has been taken over by the undead. A few living people are kept around to provide blood for the vampires and to operate the gas station and shops in the daytime. Knowing of the anthropologist's refusal to moralise about other people's lifestyles (in the opening scene he is seen refusing to interfere in a human sacrifice and concerned only for the quality of the film he is shooting), the vampires employ him to write their story. As the vampires' evil nature becomes clear, the anthropologist is joined by a Nazi hunter (played by Samuel Fuller) who helps him save his son, and at the climax the master vampire is impaled on the American flag instead of the traditional stake.

Swamy Ra Ra,"comedy, thriller","A Gold Vinayaka Idol of value of nearly ₹100 million in the International Market is stolen by the temple priest (Vishvesh) of the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple with the help of a Security Guard. The Idol, which actually belongs to the newly found treasure of the Temple is sold to a mysterious person who dies after his car meets with an accident. A kid takes the Idol from the ground and presents it to his friend who in turn presents it to her daughter in law. That man sells this Idol to a Goldsmith at Alappuzha of Kerala for ₹6,000. That Goldsmith sells it to another rich man at Mangalore of Karnataka for ₹37,000. He in turn sells it to another rich man at Shimoga of Karnataka for ₹1,90,000.

Th idol is sold to a millionaire at Thiruchanur of Tamil Nadu for 2 million which in turn is sold at Madurai for 6 million which reaches to a Trader at Hyderabad for a value of ₹11 million.
The story then shifts to four lives Surya (Nikhil Siddharth), Bhanu (Pooja Ramachandran), Ravi (Sathya) and Swati (Swati Reddy). While Surya, Bhanu, Ravi are pick pocketers who rob people together, Swati is a Journalist whose parents left for USA for a short duration. Swati buys a Yellow color Vespa vehicle which is stolen by Surya while being chased by a person as Surya and Ravi rob him. After giving complaint to the Police, Swati finds Surya riding her Vehicle. Surya, after being stopped by Swati, represents himself as a Software Engineer working at HP who bought this vehicle from a Third party. Surya and Swati become friends and Surya later introduces Bhanu and Ravi to Swati as his colleagues in HP. Mean while Giri (Ravi Varma) goes to buy the Idol from the Trader on behalf of Durga Prasad (Ravi Babu), a criminal whose obligation is to deliver the Idol to a Minister in order to get exonerated from all his cases and joining politics. Giri kills the Trader, takes the Idol and goes to Durga's house and gives him the money he sent for and tells that the trader was dead and the Idol is missing.
Later Durga gives the same Money Bag to his personal Lawyer and finds Blood Stains on the Bag. He sends his henchmen to trace Giri and get the Idol from him. However Giri keeps the Idol in the Hand Bag of Swati when he hits Surya and Swati when they were riding their Vespa vehicle and notes the vehicle number. At Swati's home, Chotu, a kid who is a friend of Surya, steals the Idol from her hand bag and gives it to Surya. Surya along with Bhanu and Ravi approaches Shankar (Jeeva) via Jogi (Praveen), who is entitled for a commission of 10% of the sale price. Shankar decides to sell it for ₹50 million but Ravi foolishly reveals in a hurry that they are lucky to get ₹0.5 million. They go to Swati's house that night and celebrate terming salary hike as the reason. Next morning Durga goes to Swati's home, searches her handbag, kills Giri in front of them and demands them to tell the whereabouts of the Idol. During the Journey to Shankar's house, two professional killers (Jogi Krishnam Raju and Jogi Naidu) threaten them to vacate the car as they are in a hurry to escape from the police. At this point the trio and Swati flee to Swati's friend Dolly's house.
Shankar sells the Idol to two Africans (Alex and Elves) who approached Shankar via Jogi. There one of the African gets tempted after he sees Vijji (Shravanthi), a close person of Shankar. Jogi is insulted by Shankar by denying to give his commission after the African party left away. Jogi is humiliated by this and calls the trio to meet him the next hour. There Jogi asks Surya to get Shankar's purse before he reaches the place of Consignment where the price would be transferred by showing a 10 Dollars note given by the African Duo. If the note is brought, it would be shared among the trio and Jogi in equal ratio. The trio successfully get his purse without his knowledge and tear the note into two equal halves, one with Surya and one with Jogi. Surya then comes to know that Swati is kidnapped by Durga and he requires the Idol in an hour in order to set Swati free. Thus Surya calls Shankar and comes to know by him that the Idol is in Novotel after he gave his half note. Jogi then calls Shankar to bring ₹50 million if he needs the other half to Novotel. Meanwhile, Vijji seduces the African, ties his hands with a tight shirt and gets the locker code and flees away with the Idol. Surya after trashing the other in the same way comes to know about the Locker code, goes to the room only to find an empty locker and being chased by the African Duo with Guns in their hands.
At the cellar of Novotel Shankar gets his half note and shows the ₹50 million cash in a bag. In no time the trio, ignorant of the presence of the bag in the car, get into it along with Vijji and go away. Shankar chases them in his car, Jogi chases them in his friend's car, the African Duo chase them in a car which they get by threatening the owner of it to vacate. Bhanu snatches the Idol from Vijji and leaves her away on the road. Surya is summoned by Durga to Dog House to give the Idol and take Swati away. The cars of Surya, Shankar, Jogi, African Duo, Minister reach there and all of them enter the Dog House. The Professional Killers, who robbed Durga's car in the past are employed by the Minister to kill Durga, reach there and wait outside for the right time. Here, Surya is aimed by Shankar by a Gun who inturn is aimed by Jogi with a Gun. Jogi is aimed by the African Duo who are inturn aimed by Durga.

Due Date,"comedy, road","Peter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr.), a successful architect, is due to fly home from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be with his wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan), who is about to give birth. On the way to the airport, he has a chance encounter with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), who is going to LA to be an actor and is planning to scatter his recently deceased father's ashes at the Grand Canyon. When Ethan misuses the words ""terrorist"" and ""bomb"" while talking to Peter, they are both escorted off the plane. This is only the first of a series of misadventures caused by the drastically dysfunctional Ethan. Peter, now on the No Fly List and missing his wallet, agrees to drive with Ethan to Los Angeles.
Ethan stops to buy marijuana, and Peter discovers that they are nearly out of money. Since Peter has no I.D., he gets his wife to wire the money to Ethan, but discovers Ethan had the money wired to his stage name instead of his legal name. When the Western Union employee (Danny McBride) refuses to accept Ethan's ""Stage name I.D."" it leads to a violent altercation.
After a night at a rest stop, Peter decides to drive off and abandon Ethan, but realizes that he still has Ethan's father's ashes, having forgotten to unload them with the rest of Ethan's stuff when he left. This causes him to wrestle with his conscience, and he decides to return. Ethan drives so Peter can get some rest, but he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes the car. After Peter and Ethan are picked up by Peter's friend Darryl (Jamie Foxx), Peter again decides to part company with Ethan. Darryl initially persuades him otherwise, but then throws Ethan out after mistakenly drinking some of Ethan's father's ashes, which were stored in a coffee tin.
When Darryl lets them use his Range Rover to make the rest of the trip, Ethan mistakenly drives to the Mexico–United States border. Despite assuring Peter that he'll handle the situation, Ethan flees, and Peter is arrested for possession of marijuana. The Mexican Federal Police lock Peter up, but Ethan steals a truck and breaks him out, causing several car crashes in the process.
They stop at the Grand Canyon, and Ethan finally scatters his father's ashes. Peter then confesses that he tried to leave Ethan at the rest area. Ethan makes a confession of his own: he has had Peter's wallet and I.D the entire time. Peter seemingly forgives him but then attacks Ethan in a rage, but is interrupted by a call from Sarah, who has just gone into labor. Peter and Ethan leave for California. Ethan finds a gun in the truck and he accidentally shoots Peter. Arriving at the hospital where Sarah is in labor, Peter passes out from loss of blood.

Mother Night,drama,"Confined in an Israeli jail, Howard W. Campbell, Jr. writes a memoir about his career in Nazi Germany. During the buildup to World War II, Campbell, an American playwright of German language stage productions, is approached by War Department operative Frank Wirtanen. Wirtanen asks Campbell to work as a spy for the U.S. in the approaching war, though he promises no reward or recognition. Campbell rejects the offer, but Wirtanen adds that he wants Campbell to take some time to consider, telling him that Campbell's answer will come in the form of how he acts and what positions he assumes once the war begins.
In the initial stages of the war, Campbell works his way up through Joseph Goebbels' propaganda organization, eventually becoming the ""voice"" of English language broadcasts propagating Nazism and anti-Semitism at U.S. citizens. Unknown to the Nazis, all of the idiosyncrasies of his speech – deliberate pauses, coughing, etc. – form a secret code that covertly transmits information to Allied forces. Late in the war, after his wife, Helga, is reported killed on the Eastern Front, Campbell visits her family in early 1945 outside Berlin, just before the Red Army arrives. Helga's younger sister, Resi, confesses that she is in love with him.
Eventually, Campbell is captured when a U.S. infantryman recognizes his voice. Before he can be executed, Wirtanen arranges for Campbell's discreet release and helps his relocation to New York City. Campbell is shocked to learn that the Americans will not reveal Campbell's true role in the war, because that would also reveal the spycraft techniques that America will continue to need for the next war. Although that means that Campbell is doomed to be a pariah, Wirtanen is unsympathetic, reasoning that Campbell would not have wanted the truth had Germany won the war.
In New York City, Campbell lives a lonely existence for fifteen years, sustained only by memories of Helga and an indifferent curiosity about his eventual fate. Mrs. Epstein, a Holocaust survivor living in Campbell's building, is the only person who suspects his true identity; he seems to avoid her suspicions by feigning ignorance of German. Campbell's only friend is George Kraft, an elderly painter who, through an extraordinary coincidence, happens to be a Soviet intelligence agent.
Over many games of chess, Campbell reveals his secret past to Kraft, who tries to use this information to improve his standing with his handlers by forcing Campbell into a position where he must flee to Moscow. He leaks information about Campbell's whereabouts, which gets the attention of a neo-Nazi organization. Representatives of this group meet Campbell and present him with who seems to be Helga. However, it is not long before Campbell discovers that Helga is actually Resi, who had taken Helga's identity to escape East Germany.
The neo-Nazis shelter Campbell, along with Kraft and Resi, in their Manhattan hideout. Wirtanen reappears, warning Campbell of Kraft's true identity and explaining that Kraft and Resi have put Campbell in an awkward position with the neo-Nazis to ensure his transfer to Moscow. Campbell returns to the hideout to confront the pair; in light of her exposure, Resi commits suicide. Moments later, the FBI raids the hideout but, again, Wirtanen uses his influence to ensure Campbell walks free. Campbell returns to his wrecked apartment and decides to turn himself in to the Israelis to stand trial.

Cujo,horror,"Cujo, an easygoing St. Bernard, chases a wild rabbit and inserts his head in a cave, where a rabid bat bites his nose. Meanwhile, the Trenton family – advertiser Vic, housewife Donna, and their sensitive young son Tad – take their car to the rural home of abusive mechanic Joe Camber for some repairs, where they meet Cujo (the dog from the prologue), who is the Camber family's pet. Donna notices Cujo's bite, but thinks little of it. Later, Vic and Donna's marriage is tested when Vic learns that Donna is having an affair with her ex-boyfriend from high school, Steve Kemp, while Vic's advertising for a cereal commercial is failing. Charity and Brett, Joe's wife and son leave the house for a week to visit Charity's sister Holly. When the bite infection drives Cujo mad, he kills their alcoholic neighbor, Gary Pervier and Joe (who fails to call the authorities).
Vic goes out of town on a business trip, as Donna and Tad return to the Camber's house for more car repairs. Cujo attacks them, and they take shelter in their Ford Pinto. Donna tries to drive home, but the car's alternator dies and the two are trapped inside. The hot sun makes conditions nearly unbearable, and Donna realizes that she must do something before they both die from heatstroke or dehydration. However, attempts at escape are foiled by Cujo's repeated attacks. Vic returns home to rekindle his marriage, only to find Donna and Tad missing and his house vandalized by Kemp. He suspects the possessive Kemp of kidnapping, but then realizes his wife and son might be at the Cambers' residence.
The local sheriff, George Bannerman, arrives at the house and has a brief standoff, before Cujo kills him, knocking him off the catwalk in the barn, mauling him to death. Meanwhile, Donna takes advantage of a momentary distraction and hits Cujo with a baseball bat until it breaks, leaving only a jagged handle. Cujo jumps at her and is impaled in the stomach by the broken bat. Donna takes the sheriff's revolver and retrieves a dehydrated and overheated Tad. As Donna revives Tad in the house, a recovered Cujo breaks through the kitchen window and tries to kill them. However, Donna shoots Cujo dead, before Vic arrives and reunites with his family.",horror cujo easygoing st bernard chase wild rabbit insert head cave rabid bat bite nose trenton family advertiser vic housewife donna sensitive young son tad car rural home abusive mechanic joe camber repair meet cujo dog prologue camber family pet donna notice cujo bite think little later vic donna marriage test vic learn donna have affair ex boyfriend high school steve kemp vic advertising cereal commercial fail charity brett joe wife son leave house week visit charity sister holly bite infection drive cujo mad kill alcoholic neighbor gary pervier joe fail authority vic go town business trip donna tad return camber house car repair cujo attack shelter ford pinto donna try drive home car alternator die trap inside hot sun make condition nearly unbearable donna realize die heatstroke dehydration attempt escape foil cujo repeat attack vic return home rekindle marriage find donna tad missing house vandalize kemp suspect possessive kemp kidnapping realize wife son camber residence local sheriff george bannerman arrive house brief standoff cujo kill knock catwalk barn maul death donna take advantage momentary distraction hit cujo baseball bat break leave jagged handle cujo jump impale stomach broken bat donna take sheriff revolver retrieve dehydrated overheat tad donna revive tad house recover cujo break kitchen window try kill donna shoot cujo dead vic arrive reunite family

Jubilee,punk/avant-garde,"Queen Elizabeth I (Jenny Runacre) is transported forward in time by the occultist John Dee (Richard O'Brien) by the aid of the spirit guide Ariel (a character from William Shakespeare's The Tempest) whom he commands. Elizabeth arrives in the shattered Britain of the 1970s. Queen Elizabeth II is dead, killed in an arbitrary mugging, and Elizabeth I moves through the social and physical decay of the city observing the sporadic activities of a group of aimless nihilists, including Amyl Nitrite (Jordan), Bod (Runacre in a dual role), Chaos (Hermine Demoriane), Crabs (Nell Campbell), and Mad (Toyah Willcox).
Numerous punk icons appear in the film including Jordan (a Malcolm McLaren protégé), Toyah Willcox, Nell Campbell, Adam Ant, Hermine Demoriane and Wayne County. It features performances by Wayne County and Adam and the Ants. There are also cameo appearances by the Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The film was scored by Brian Eno. The uncredited piece of music used in the 'Jordan's Dance' scene was written by Ludwig Minkus in 1884 for Act I of the revived ballet Giselle.[3]
Beginning with a scene where John Dee summons the spirit Ariel for Queen Elizabeth I, the action moves to an anarchic present day, where law and order has broken down and punk gangs roam the streets, committing acts of murder and larceny. In one squat, Amyl Nitrate is instructing a group of young women —in so doing valourising the violent criminal activity of Myra Hindley—before she reminisces about her time as a ballet dancer and introduces the audience to Mad, Crabs, Chaos, Sphinx and Angel (two incestuous bisexual brothers) and Bod, a sex-hating anarchist. Bod has just strangled and killed Elizabeth II and stolen her crown.
From there the group move on to a café, where Crabs picks up a young musician named the Kid, Mad tears up some postcards and Bod attacks a waitress with a bottle of ketchup. Bod contacts impresario Borgia Ginz. On meeting Ginz, however, she is surprised to find Amyl performing a pastiche of ""Rule Britannia"". Sphinx and Angel establish a relationship with Viv, a young former artist, whom they take to meet Max, an ex-soldier. In exchange for sexual favours, Crabs takes the Kid to see Ginz, who auditions him and his band signs them up under the name ""Scum."" Sphinx and Angel try to talk the Kid out of this but he just laughs at their lecturing. Ginz is branching out into property management and has purchased 'abandoned' properties like Westminster Cathedral and Buckingham Palace, which are transformed into musical venues.
Meanwhile, Mad, Bod and Crabs asphyxiate Happy Days, one of Crabs' one-night stands, with red plastic sheeting and break into the flat of androgynous rock star Lounge Lizard whom Bod throttles to death. A fight breaks out at a disco session in St. Paul's Crypt between Kid and a policeman. After the gang all watch Kid's TV debut together, Viv and the three males all pay a visit to Max's bingo hall, where Violent police activity causes the death of Sphinx, Angel, and the Kid and two revenge attacks on the police officers responsible. One of them is castrated to death by Mad and Amyl; the other, who has just started an affair with Crabs, is blown up on his doorstep with a petrol bomb by Bod. Finally, Ginz takes the four women off to Dorset and signs a recording contract with them. Interspersed with these displays of contemporary anarchic violence, Dee, Ariel and Elizabeth try to interpret the signs of anarchic modernity around them, before they undertake a pastoral and nostalgic return to the sixteenth century at the film's end.",punk avant garde queen elizabeth jenny runacre transport forward time occultist john dee richard aid spirit guide ariel character william shakespeare temp command elizabeth arrive shattered britain queen elizabeth ii dead kill arbitrary mugging elizabeth move social physical decay city observe sporadic activity group aimless nihilist include amyl nitrite jordan bod runacre dual role chaos hermine demoriane crabs nell campbell mad toyah willcox numerous punk icon appear film include jordan malcolm mclaren protégé toyah willcox nell campbell adam ant hermine demoriane wayne county feature performance wayne county adam ant cameo appearance slit siouxsie banshee film score brian eno uncredited piece music jordan dance scene write ludwig minkus act revive ballet begin scene john dee summon spirit ariel queen elizabeth action move anarchic present day law order break punk gang roam street commit act murder larceny squat amyl nitrate instruct group young woman valourise violent criminal activity myra hindley reminisce time ballet dancer introduce audience mad crab chaos sphinx angel incestuous bisexual brother bod sex hate anarchist bod strangle kill elizabeth ii steal crown group café crab pick young musician name kid mad tear postcard bod attack waitress bottle ketchup bod contacts impresario borgia ginz meet ginz surprised find amyl perform pastiche rule britannia sphinx angel establish relationship viv young artist meet max ex soldier exchange sexual favour crab take kid ginz audition band sign scum sphinx angel try talk kid laugh lecturing ginz branch property management purchase abandon property like westminster cathedral buckingham palace transform musical venue mad bod crab asphyxiate happy day crab night stand red plastic sheeting break flat androgynous rock star lounge lizard bod throttle death fight break disco session st paul crypt kid policeman gang watch kid tv debut viv male pay visit max bingo hall violent police activity cause death sphinx angel kid revenge attack police officer responsible castrate death mad amyl start affair crab blow doorstep petrol bomb bod finally ginz take woman dorset sign recording contract intersperse display contemporary anarchic violence dee ariel elizabeth try interpret sign anarchic modernity undertake pastoral nostalgic return sixteenth century film end

Hide and Seek,horror,"Following his discovery of the body of his wife (Amy Irving) in a bathtub after her apparent suicide, Dr. David Callaway (Robert De Niro), a psychologist working in New York City, decides to move with his 9-year-old daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) to Upstate New York. There, Emily makes an apparently imaginary friend she calls ""Charlie"". Her friendship with Charlie begins to disturb David when he discovers their cat dead in the bathtub, who, Emily claims, was a victim of ""Charlie"". Meanwhile, David has nightmares of the New Year's Eve party that occurred the night before his wife died.
When a family friend, Dr. Katherine Carson (Famke Janssen), comes to visit David and Emily, Emily reveals that she and Charlie have a mutual desire to upset her father. Soon, they meet Laura (Melissa Leo) and Stephen (Robert John Burke) who are their neighbors. David is wary of their unusual interest in Emily. He later discovers that the reason for this is that the couple had a daughter who recently died from cancer and looked like Emily. Later, when David visits Laura, she nervously and ambiguously implies that her husband has begun abusing her in response to their child's death, emotionally and perhaps physically.
David meets Elizabeth Young (Elisabeth Shue), a local woman, and her niece, Amy, who is roughly the same age as Emily. Hoping to cultivate a new, healthy friendship for Emily, David sets up a play date for her. Amy is anxious to become friends immediately, but the play date is spoiled when Emily cuts up Amy's doll's face. After Amy runs out of the house, Emily tells David that she doesn't need any more friends.
Despite the unsuccessful play date, David and Elizabeth hit it off. David invites her over to dinner one night, where Emily acts increasingly hostile towards her. Some time later, Elizabeth visits the house, hoping to make peace with Emily. When Emily tells her that she is playing hide-and-seek with Charlie, Elizabeth indulges her by pretending to look for Charlie. When she opens the closet, someone bursts out and pushes Elizabeth out a second-story window to her death.
After the police discover her car crashed near David's house, David asks Emily what happened. Emily claims Charlie caused her death by pushing her out the window and forced Emily to help him move the body. She tells David the location of her body. A terrified David discovers Elizabeth's body in the bathroom in a bathtub full of blood. David asks Emily where Charlie is, and Emily tells him that Charlie has ""just left"".
David, armed with a knife, goes outside, where he meets the neighbor who has become friends with Emily. David assumes that his neighbor is Charlie and begins to act aggressively. Becoming suspicious that David has killed his own daughter, the neighbor asks to see Emily, but David cuts the neighbor with his knife. The neighbor then calls the police.
Back in the house, David finds that, although he has been in his study many times (listening to his stereo and writing a journal), the boxes were actually never unpacked after the move. With this, David realizes that he has dissociative identity disorder and that Charlie is not imaginary at all, but that in fact ""Charlie"" is David himself. Whenever ""Charlie"" would emerge, David was in his study. Charlie was actually in control. David also realizes that under his Charlie personality, he killed his wife and then made it appear to be a suicide. He also fully recalls the events of the New Year's Eve party the night before his wife's death. Immediately after the countdown to midnight, David noticed his wife slip away. He followed her and caught her in a stairwell making out with another guest. ""Charlie"" was created as a way for David's rage to murder his wife, something that the docile David himself was too decent to do. Emily knew the entire time about her father's split personality, but did not tell him because she was unsure which personality murdered her mother, suspecting David until ""Charlie"" killed Elizabeth.
Once Charlie's identity and horrible deeds are realized to David, he becomes completely consumed by Charlie, leading him to murder the local sheriff (Dylan Baker), who arrives to investigate the previous altercation. Emily calls Katherine for help.
Katherine arrives and is pushed down the basement stairs by 'Charlie'. Charlie/David, determined to play a hideous game of hide-and-seek with Emily once again, starts counting. Emily dashes and hides. She tricks Charlie and manages to lock herself in her room. As Charlie tries to break in, she climbs out from the window and runs into the cave where she originally met Charlie.
Meanwhile, Katherine takes the gun from the dead sheriff, breaks out of the basement, and finds Charlie looking for Emily in the cave. Charlie pretends to be David and attacks Katherine when she lowers her guard. Katherine begs for David to come out and fight his murderous other personality. Charlie tells Katherine that David no longer exists; from the minute David discovered the truth about himself, this enabled Charlie to fully take over. Emily emerges from her hiding place, begging Charlie to let Katherine go. Her distraction allows Katherine to shoot Charlie, killing him at last.
Sometime later, in one of several endings, Emily is preparing for school in her new life with Katherine. But Emily's drawing of herself with two heads, suggests that she might also have dissociative identity disorder.",horror follow discovery body wife amy irving bathtub apparent suicide dr david callaway robert de niro psychologist work new york city decide year old daughter emily dakota fanning upstate new york emily make apparently imaginary friend call charlie friendship charlie begin disturb david discover cat dead bathtub emily claim victim charlie david nightmare new year eve party occur night wife die family friend dr katherine carson famke janssen come visit david emily emily reveal charlie mutual desire upset father soon meet laura melissa leo stephen robert john burke neighbor david wary unusual interest emily later discover reason couple daughter recently die cancer look like emily later david visit laura nervously ambiguously imply husband begin abuse response child death emotionally physically david meet elizabeth young elisabeth shue local woman niece amy roughly age emily hope cultivate new healthy friendship emily david set play date amy anxious friend immediately play date spoil emily cut amy doll face amy run house emily tell david need friend despite unsuccessful play date david elizabeth hit david invite dinner night emily act increasingly hostile time later elizabeth visit house hope peace emily emily tell play hide seek charlie elizabeth indulge pretend look charlie open closet burst push elizabeth second story window death police discover car crash near david house david ask emily happen emily claim charlie cause death push window force emily help body tell david location body terrified david discover elizabeth body bathroom bathtub blood david ask emily charlie emily tell charlie leave david arm knife go outside meet neighbor friend emily david assume neighbor charlie begin act aggressively suspicious david kill daughter neighbor ask emily david cut neighbor knife neighbor call police house david find study time listen stereo write journal box actually unpacked david realize dissociative identity disorder charlie imaginary fact charlie david charlie emerge david study charlie actually control david realize charlie personality kill wife appear suicide fully recall event new year eve party night wife death immediately countdown midnight david notice wife slip away follow catch stairwell making guest charlie create way david rage murder wife docile david decent emily know entire time father split personality tell unsure personality murder mother suspect david charlie kill elizabeth charlie identity horrible deed realize david completely consume charlie lead murder local sheriff dylan baker arrive investigate previous altercation emily call katherine help katherine arrive push basement stair charlie charlie david determine play hideous game hide seek emily start count emily dash hide trick charlie manage lock room charlie try break climb window run cave originally meet charlie katherine take gun dead sheriff break basement find charlie look emily cave charlie pretend david attack katherine lower guard katherine beg david come fight murderous personality charlie tell katherine david long exist minute david discover truth enable charlie fully emily emerge hiding place beg charlie let katherine distraction allow katherine shoot charlie kill later ending emily prepare school new life katherine emily drawing head suggest dissociative identity disorder
The Pledge,crime drama,"Retired police detective Jerry Black (Nicholson) is seen mumbling to himself, apparently drunk, sitting on a bench outside a disused gas station. The scene then shifts to events in the recent past. The Department has thrown him a retirement party, and the police captain gives Jerry a fishing trip in Mexico as a gift. The party is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak (Eckhart), to the scene of the crime.
Jerry delivers the bad news to the child's parents, and the mother makes Jerry swear on a cross that he will find the killer. A suspect is found the next day. Stan goes in to interview the suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah (del Toro), a Native American man with mental retardation. During the interview, the man eventually confesses but steals a gun from one of the deputies and commits suicide. To the other detectives, the case is over, but Jerry does not think that Wadenah was the killer. Jerry is adamant about his pledge to find the killer, and does not go on the fishing trip. Instead, he visits the victim's grandmother, who tells him of the many stories that Ginny told. A later visit to one of her friends reveals that Ginny had a friend she called ""The Giant"". Jerry sees a picture Ginny drew of ""The Giant"", but it does not resemble Wadenah, and includes a black station wagon. He takes the drawing with him.
Jerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three unsolved and similar cases that Wadenah could not have committed. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack (Shepard) and Stan, who are doubtful.
While fishing, Jerry notices a gas station that is located near the center of the similar cases. After buying the gas station, Jerry moves into the house behind it, meets local bartender Lori (Wright Penn), and slowly becomes a father figure to her daughter Chrissy.
Soon, Chrissy becomes friends with a local pastor, Gary Jackson (Tom Noonan). Jerry is uncomfortable about this and begins to think Jackson is the killer. Chrissy is shown meeting a man driving a black car with a toy hedgehog hanging on the rear mirror, hedgehogs being another aspect of Ginny's drawing that Jerry believes to be a clue. Chrissy explains to Jerry that she met a wizard who gave her hedgehog candies and told her not to tell her parents they met. She figured it was OK to tell Jerry, since he is not her father. Jerry realizes this is the killer and, using Chrissy as bait, stages an operation, with Stan's help, to catch him.
A car is shown driving with a toy hedgehog hanging from the rear-view mirror. The woman who owned the chocolate shop is shown searching for ""Oliver"", implying that he is the killer. After hours of waiting, Stan and the other police leave. They tell Lori what happened, and she confronts Jerry angrily about putting her daughter in danger. The car that was shown approaching is seen destroyed in a fiery collision with a freight truck.
In the final scene, reprising the first, Jerry sits on a bench in front of the ruined gas station, apparently drunk, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there.",crime drama retire police detective jerry black nicholson see mumble apparently drunk sit bench outside disuse gas station scene shift event recent past department throw retirement party police captain give jerry fishing trip mexico gift party interrupt discovery murder child ginny jerry decide detective stan krolak eckhart scene crime jerry deliver bad news child parent mother make jerry swear cross find killer suspect find day stan go interview suspect toby jay wadenah del toro native american man mental retardation interview man eventually confess steal gun deputy commit suicide detective case jerry think wadenah killer jerry adamant pledge find killer fishing trip instead visit victim grandmother tell story ginny tell later visit friend reveal ginny friend call giant jerry see picture ginny drew giant resemble wadenah include black station wagon take drawing jerry go stan ask reopen case stan refuse get jerry information similar case area jerry investigation reveal unsolved similar case wadenah commit jerry present research ginny drawing captain pollack shepard stan doubtful fish jerry notice gas station locate near center similar case buy gas station jerry move house meet local bartender lori wright penn slowly father figure daughter chrissy soon chrissy friend local pastor gary jackson tom noonan jerry uncomfortable begin think jackson killer chrissy show meet man drive black car toy hedgehog hang rear mirror hedgehog aspect ginny draw jerry believe clue chrissy explain jerry meet wizard give hedgehog candy tell tell parent meet figure ok tell jerry father jerry realize killer chrissy bait stage operation stan help catch car show drive toy hedgehog hang rear view mirror woman own chocolate shop show search oliver imply killer hour waiting stan police leave tell lori happen confront jerry angrily put daughter danger car show approach see destroy fiery collision freight truck final scene reprise jerry sit bench ruin gas station apparently drunk mumble killer
The Karate Kid,martial arts,"Dre Parker and his mother Sherry Parker move from Detroit to Beijing after Sherry gets a job transfer at her car factory. After a day in a park, Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Meiying, who reciprocates his attention, but another boy Cheng, a rebellious kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, attempts to keep them apart by violently attacking Dre, and later bullies him at school. During an attack, the maintenance man, Mr. Han comes to Dre's aid, and when Cheng and his friends try to interfere, Han defeats each of them in close combat, revealing himself as a kung fu master.
After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to make peace. Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Han instead proposes that Dre compete against Li's students at an open martial arts tournament, and also requests the students leave Dre alone to train in time for the tournament. Li accepts the offer, but warns Han that if Dre does not show up during the tournament, he will personally bring pain to Han and Dre.
Han promises to teach Dre kung fu and begins to train Dre by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art. He teaches this by having Dre go through various actions with his jacket, which teaches Dre muscle memory moves. Han then takes Dre to a Taoist temple in the Wudang Mountains where he trained with his father, and Dre witnesses a woman making a cobra reflect her movements and drinks the water from an ancient Taoist well.
As Dre's friendship with Meiying continues, they share a kiss at the festival. Dre persuades Meiying to cut school for a day of fun, but when she is nearly late for her violin audition which was brought forward a day without their knowledge, her parents deem him a bad influence and forbid her from spending more time with him.
During the course of their training, Han gives Dre a day off. Dre goes to Han that night and finds Han, apparently drunk, smashing a car he was working on. Han tells Dre that he crashed the same car years ago, and that his wife and ten-year-old son were with him and died in the car crash. Han fixes the car every year but smashes it to remind himself of what happened, which makes Dre work much harder in his training in order to help Han forget about the incident. Han assists Dre in writing a note of apology to Meiying's father in Chinese; he accepts and promises that Meiying will attend the tournament to support Dre.
At the tournament, the under-confident Dre is slow to achieve parity with his opponents, but soon begins beating them and advances to the semifinals, as does Cheng, who violently finishes off his opponents. Dre comes up against Liang, one of Li's more sympathetic students and the least vicious of Dre's tormentors, who (under Li's goading) severely hurts Dre's leg and Liang is disqualified as a result, while Dre is taken to the infirmary.
Despite Han's insistence that he has earned respect for his performance, Dre convinces Han to mend his leg by using fire cupping in order to continue. Dre returns to the arena, facing Cheng in the final. Dre delivers impressive blows, but Li orders Cheng to break Dre's leg. Cheng is horrified at the order, but obeys under Li's intimidation. As the match continues, Cheng seizes Dre's leg and delivers a vicious blow, doing further damage. Dre struggles to get up, and attempts the reflection technique to manipulate Cheng into changing his attack stance. Cheng begins reflecting Dre's movements and it goads him into charging Dre, but Dre flips and catches Cheng with a kick to his head, winning the tournament along with the respect of Cheng and his classmates. Cheng, instead of the presenter, awards Dre the trophy, and the Fighting Dragon students bow to Mr. Han in respect, accepting him as their new master.
Li attempts to strike Cheng out of anger for Cheng's failure in the ring, but Han appears and prevents Li from doing so, resulting in a vicious fight with Li. While Li momentarily bests Han, Han pins Li down with a leg to head lock, and angrily reminds him his own rule; no mercy. Before Han attacks his nemesis, Dre appears, and discourages Han from his intentions, the Fighting Dragons students bow to Mr. Han, and the two leave. As a defeated and humiliated Li rises, Sherry and Meiying leave. However, Sherry stops to turn around briefly and punches Li in the jaw, presumably from finding out that he ordered his students to brutally attack her son.",martial art dre parker mother sherry parker detroit beijing sherry get job transfer car factory day park dre develop crush young violinist meiying reciprocate attention boy cheng rebellious kung fu prodigy family close meiying attempt apart violently attack dre later bully school attack maintenance man mr han come dre aid cheng friend try interfere han defeat close combat reveal kung fu master han mends dre injury fire cupping dre ask mr han teach kung fu han refuse meet cheng teacher master li peace li teach student mercy enemy challenge dre fight cheng han instead propose dre compete li student open martial art tournament request student leave dre train time tournament li accept offer warn han dre tournament personally bring pain han dre han promise teach dre kung fu begin train dre emphasize movement apply life general serenity maturity punch power true key master martial art teach have dre action jacket teach dre muscle memory move han take dre taoist temple wudang mountain train father dre witness woman make cobra reflect movement drink water ancient taoist dre friendship meiying continue share kiss festival dre persuade meiye cut school day fun nearly late violin audition bring forward day knowledge parent deem bad influence forbid spend time course training han give dre day dre go han night find han apparently drunk smash car work han tell dre crash car year ago wife year old son die car crash han fixes car year smash remind happen make dre work hard training order help han forget incident han assist dre write note apology meiying father chinese accept promise meiying attend tournament support dre tournament confident dre slow achieve parity opponent soon begin beat advance semifinal cheng violently finish opponent dre come liang li sympathetic student vicious dre tormentor li goading severely hurt dre leg liang disqualify result dre take infirmary despite han insistence earn respect performance dre convince han mend leg fire cup order continue dre return arena face cheng final dre deliver impressive blow li orders cheng break dre leg cheng horrify order obey li intimidation match continue cheng seize dre leg deliver vicious blow damage dre struggle attempt reflection technique manipulate cheng change attack stance cheng begin reflect dre movement goad charge dre dre flip catch cheng kick head win tournament respect cheng classmate cheng instead presenter award dre trophy fight dragon student bow mr han respect accept new master li attempt strike cheng anger cheng failure ring han appear prevent li result vicious fight li li momentarily best han han pins li leg head lock angrily remind rule mercy han attack nemesis dre appear discourage han intention fighting dragon student bow mr han leave defeated humiliate li rise sherry meiying leave sherry stop turn briefly punch li jaw presumably find order student brutally attack son
The Carpenter,slasher film,"After being released from the institution she was placed in after suffering a mental breakdown, housewife Alice Jarett relocates to the country with her husband Martin, a professor. The house the couple moves into was never finished, so Martin hires a cheap construction crew to complete it. One night, Alice is awakened by hammering in the basement, caused by a carpenter she had not seen with the rest of the crew. Unlike the other workers, this one has a pleasant demeanor and good work ethic, and while Martin is away one night, he stops another carpenter from trying to rape Alice by cutting the man's arms off with a circular saw, sending the dazed Alice back to bed, and cleaning up the mess afterward.
Alice has a few more run-ins with the carpenter, and comes to the conclusion that he is the spirit of the house's builder, a man named Edward who was executed for killing several repo men when his obsession with perfecting his home caused him to incur massive debt. Despite Ed's murderous past, Alice finds herself falling for his charms, even after witnessing him murder two disgruntled former workers who break into the house to loot it.
One day, one of Martin's students, Laura Bell, shows up at the house, to confess to Alice that she and Martin are having an affair, and that she is pregnant with his child. An argument breaks out between Laura and Alice, who kills Laura with a nail gun with help from Ed. When Martin returns home and discovers Laura's mangled body, he attacks Alice, but is subdued and has his head crushed in a vise by Ed. Sometime later, Alice's sister Racheal stops by, and tries to leave with Alice after spotting Martin and Laura's bodies, but she is stopped by Ed, who gets violent with her. Angered by Ed harming her sister, Alice turns against him, and the two fight. During the scuffle, Alice realizes that damaging the house hurts Ed, so she starts a fire with a blow torch. As the flames spread through the house, Alice and a recovered Racheal flee, being briefly chased by Ed before he burns away.",slasher film release institution place suffer mental breakdown housewife alice jarett relocate country husband martin professor house couple move finish martin hire cheap construction crew complete night alice awaken hammer basement cause carpenter see rest crew unlike worker pleasant demeanor good work ethic martin away night stop carpenter try rape alice cut man arm circular saw send daze alice bed clean mess afterward alice run in carpenter come conclusion spirit house builder man name edward execute kill repo man obsession perfect home cause incur massive debt despite ed murderous past alice find fall charm witness murder disgruntle worker break house loot day martin student laura bell show house confess alice martin have affair pregnant child argument break laura alice kill laura nail gun help ed martin return home discover laura mangle body attack alice subdue head crush vise ed later alice sister racheal stop try leave alice spot martin laura body stop ed get violent anger ed harm sister alice turn fight scuffle alice realize damage house hurt ed start fire blow torch flame spread house alice recover racheal flee briefly chase ed burn away

Kai Po Che!,drama,"The film begins with Govind ""Govi"" Patel (Rajkumar Rao) giving a presentation in a school about the services provided by his sports club. In a parallel scene, Omkar ""Omi"" Shastri (Amit Sadh) is released from prison. While halting at a restaurant mid-way, Govind and Omi recall their days back to the year 2000 with the life of their late friend Ishaan.
12 Years Ago
Ishaan ""Ish"" Bhatt (Sushant Singh Rajput) is an ex district level cricketer who is a victim of politics in the cricketing selection fraternity, Omi is the nephew of a Hindu politician, Bittu, who funds his father's temple and Govind is a geek with a penchant for business and numbers. Together they open a sports shop and an academy to train and promote talented budding cricketers. After toiling hard, they succeed in establishing it as a center for cricket among the local youth and start to incur profits.
Ishaan requests Govind to teach his sister Vidya (Amrita Puri) mathematics as her exams are coming up. Govind is reluctant at first but agrees eventually. Vidya and Govind gradually fall in love with each other and secretly begin a physical relationship. Omi discovers the same and warns Govind of the consequences, as Ishaan is very protective of his sister.
The three friends spot a budding cricketing talent in a local boy, Ali Haider (Digvijay Deshmukh), who has a rare talent, and Ishaan starts training him vigorously. Govind is ambitious and wants to expand the budding business by opening a shop in a mall being constructed in Navrangpura, an upcoming part of the city. With financial help coming from Omi's maternal uncle, Bittu (Manav Kaul), the trio secure the deal and set up shop in the mall. Disaster strikes when a destructive earthquake hits Gujarat and the mall is destroyed. Govind is shattered as the amount of money they invested was very large and they are now loaded with a huge debt. Omi is reluctantly forced to work for Bittu's right-wing party due to the money they owe him.
When relief camps of Bittu's party declines to give Muslims shelter in troubled times, Ishaan and Omi quarrel over their politico-religious outlook and temporarily break off their friendship. They again reunite after India's surprise win in the test match against Australia. Omi gets busy with religious politics and joins Bittu's party. Ishaan and Govind, meanwhile, are busy with Ali and Vidya respectively. Tension arises in the political sphere when Bittu loses the elections in his constituency to his opponent. As a part of their campaigning, Bittu sends pilgrims (kar sevaks) to Ayodhya to the Ram Temple. Omi's parents were also among them. On the returning day, the shocking news of the Godhra train massacre reaches the people. Omi is shattered but Bittu convinces him to take revenge on the murderers of his parents.
Ishaan and Govind hide in Ali's house, fearing the communal riots which were about to start. As expected, the violence starts by sunset, and the mob led by Bittu storms into the Muslim locality, killing each and every Muslim in sight. A fight ensues between Ali's father Hussain (Asif Basra) and Bittu. Hussain stabs Bittu in defense and rushes to save Ali and take shelter in their attic. Omi, enraged at the death of his uncle Bittu, follows him with a gun. Meanwhile, Ishaan comes to know about Vidya and Govind's relationship, when he reads Vidya's text message in Govind's mobile phone about her periods. Enraged, he starts thrashing Govind while Omi enters the premises with a gun in hand, desperate to find and kill Ali and Hussain. Ishaan and Govind break their own fighting and try to stop Omi as he desperately searches for Ali and Hussain. Omi finally aims and shoots at Ali. Ishaan in a bid to save Ali takes the bullet himself and consequently dies, leaving both friends and Vidya devastated.
Present Day
The film then goes back to where it started, with Omi being released from prison ten years later. Govind and Vidya are married and have a son, whom they have named Ishaan after the late Ishaan. The film ends with a now grown up Ali (Tahir Raj Bhasin) debuting for the Indian cricket team against Australia. He plays his first shot by hitting the ball to the boundary with a cover drive just like his ""Ishaan Bhaiya"" had taught him.",drama film begin govind govi patel rajkumar rao give presentation school service provide sport club parallel scene omkar omi shastri amit sadh release prison halt restaurant mid way govind omi recall day year life late friend ishaan year ago ishaan ish bhatt sushant singh rajput ex district level cricketer victim politic cricketing selection fraternity omi nephew hindu politician bittu fund father temple govind geek penchant business number open sport shop academy train promote talented bud cricketer toil hard succeed establish center cricket local youth start incur profit ishaan request govind teach sister vidya amrita puri mathematic exam come govind reluctant agree eventually vidya govind gradually fall love secretly begin physical relationship omi discover warn govind consequence ishaan protective sister friend spot bud cricketing talent local boy ali haider digvijay deshmukh rare talent ishaan start train vigorously govind ambitious want expand bud business open shop mall construct navrangpura upcoming city financial help come omi maternal uncle bittu manav kaul trio secure deal set shop mall disaster strike destructive earthquake hit gujarat mall destroy govind shatter money invest large load huge debt omi reluctantly force work bittu right wing party money owe relief camp bittu party decline muslim shelter troubled time ishaan omi quarrel politico religious outlook temporarily break friendship reunite india surprise win test match australia omi get busy religious politic join bittu party ishaan govind busy ali vidya respectively tension arise political sphere bittu lose election constituency opponent campaigning bittu send pilgrim kar sevak ayodhya ram temple omi parent return day shocking news godhra train massacre reach people omi shatter bittu convince revenge murderer parent ishaan govind hide ali house fear communal riot start expect violence start sunset mob lead bittu storm muslim locality kill muslim sight fight ensue ali father hussain asif basra bittu hussain stabs bittu defense rush save ali shelter attic omi enrage death uncle bittu follow gun ishaan come know vidya govind relationship read vidya text message govind mobile phone period enraged start thrash govind omi enter premise gun hand desperate find kill ali hussain ishaan govind break fighting try stop omi desperately search ali hussain omi finally aim shoot ali ishaan bid save ali take bullet consequently die leave friend vidya devastate present day film go start omi release prison year later govind vidya married son name ishaan late ishaan film end grow ali tahir raj bhasin debut indian cricket team australia play shot hit ball boundary cover drive like ishaan bhaiya teach
The Darkest Hour,"action thriller, sci-fi horror","Americans Ben and Sean (Max Minghella and Emile Hirsch) travel to Moscow to sell their social networking/party locating software. As they approach the airport, their plane short circuits due to an electrical storm but regains power. After arriving, they find their Swedish business partner, Skyler (Joel Kinnaman), has betrayed them and already made a deal with the Russians, using a knockoff application. They go to a nightclub and meet Natalie (Olivia Thirlby), an American, and her Australian friend Anne (Rachael Taylor). The lights go out in the club and everyone heads outside. There, they witness what appears to be an aurora. Balls of light fall from the sky and then fade away. When a policeman investigates he is disintegrated, killing him instantly. The invisible entities begin hunting and killing people, sending them into a panic.
Ben, Sean, Natalie, Anne, and now Skyler hide in the club's storeroom for seven days. With most of their food gone, the group plans to go to the American Embassy. They find the city full of scorched cars and cinders, but empty of people, except for a wary old woman who warns them of ""the ghosts"". Ben and Sean search for supplies in a police car near Red Square while the others hide in the nearby GUM department store shopping mall. While they are searching the car, a barking dog discovers and confronts an alien, but is killed. Ben and Sean successfully hide under the car as the alien moves closer, causing the car's lights and siren to turn on. The alien moves on and the men run to the mall. Sean realizes that light bulbs and other technologies give the aliens away. The group takes shelter in one of the mall stores. Sean and Natalie go to look for clothes and almost run into an alien who can't see them through a glass wall. Sean theorises that the aliens can only see their electrical charge, but not through glass or other insulators.
The group finds the American Embassy gutted and lifeless. All except Skyler go to the roof to get an aerial view. They find a logbook telling them that the invasion is worldwide. They also find a radio broadcasting a message in Russian, and hear gunfire. Ben and Sean go outside to help Skyler, but he is killed. The others see a light in a nearby apartment tower and go to investigate, bringing the radio they found. They find a young woman named Vika and a man named Sergei, an electrical engineer. Sergei has made his apartment into a giant Faraday cage that hides everyone from the aliens. He has also developed a microwave gun that weakens an alien's force field, so that it can actually be seen and killed. Vika and Sergei translate the message, which says that a nuclear submarine K-152 Nerpa is waiting in the Moscow River to take survivors to safety.
As Sergei shows the men the microwave device, Vika, Natalie, and Anne go to other apartments to gather supplies for the submarine journey. An alien senses them outside the Faraday cage and gives chase; Anne hesitates following Vika and goes another way, causing Natalie to follow her back inside. When they get to the apartment, Natalie is unable to close the door and the alien gets inside. Sergei shoots the alien with his gun and finds that it is only stunned. The alien kills Sergei while the others get out by the fire escape. Anne hesitates again and is killed while trying to escape. Natalie sets the apartment on fire as they climb down and meet up with Vika.
They meet up with a Russian police team with improvised armor led by Boris who manage to wound an alien with conventional weapons. Sean collects a piece of the alien's body. The small police band were also able to build another Faraday cage at the Russian State Library. Boris and his men eventually agree to help the remaining four to get to the submarine. The policemen believe that the aliens are strip mining for conductive metals since giant light columns can be seen drilling all over Moscow. As they move through the subway, an alien discovers them and they escape on the tracks. Vika hides behind a pillar, unable to join the others without being seen. Ben helps her climb down to the tracks, but is killed by the alien.
The survivors make it to a powerless patrol boat on the river and drift downstream to the waiting submarine. The boat nears the submarine but runs aground. As they attempt to push free, a new light beam destroys a large apartment building right next to the river, causing the boat to capsize. Sean and the policemen swims towards the submarine but upon reaching it discover Natalie is missing. They see a flare fired from Natalie's flare gun in a railway and bus yard near the river. Sean is determined to get her, possibly missing his chance to escape. The policemen agree to help him rescue her. The Russian submarine crew, after expressing doubt about the rescue, assist by building another microwave gun with stronger batteries.
After the team manages to destroy an alien, Sean finds Natalie on a bus while the policemen and Vika destroy three more aliens using the microwave guns and water. As Sean is about to get off the bus with Natalie, an alien climbs on board, locks the door, and sends the bus speeding around the bus yard. It grabs onto Natalie's leg, but Sean blasts the alien's shield with the microwave gun. He then discovers the alien's weakness when he throws a piece of the wounded alien he had collected earlier, and it destroys the unshielded alien. The two stop the bus and narrowly avoid a collision.
After returning to the submarine, the police team decides to stay and fight for the city, and Boris tells them that now the war has begun. Sean, Natalie, and Vika plan to spread what they learned about the aliens - the microwave guns and their vulnerability to pieces of other dead aliens - to the rest of the world. Sean and Natalie, the only survivors of the original group along with Vika, nearly share a kiss on the submarine. In a pre-credit scene, as the submarine cruises through the Caspian Sea, they learn that survivors in Paris managed to destroy an alien mining tower.",action thriller sci fi horror americans ben sean max minghella emile hirsch travel moscow sell social networking party locating software approach airport plane short circuit electrical storm regain power arrive find swedish business partner skyler joel kinnaman betray deal russians knockoff application nightclub meet natalie olivia thirlby american australian friend anne rachael taylor light club head outside witness appear aurora ball light fall sky fade away policeman investigate disintegrate kill instantly invisible entity begin hunt kill people send panic ben sean natalie anne skyler hide club storeroom seven day food go group plan american embassy find city scorch car cinder people wary old woman warn ghost ben sean search supply police car near red square hide nearby gum department store shopping mall search car bark dog discover confront alien kill ben sean successfully hide car alien move close cause car light siren turn alien move man run mall sean realize light bulb technology alien away group take shelter mall store sean natalie look clothe run alien glass wall sean theorise alien electrical charge glass insulator group find american embassy gutte lifeless skyler roof aerial view find logbook tell invasion worldwide find radio broadcast message russian hear gunfire ben sean outside help skyler kill light nearby apartment tower investigate bring radio find find young woman name vika man name sergei electrical engineer sergei apartment giant faraday cage hide alien develop microwave gun weaken alien force field actually see kill vika sergei translate message say nuclear submarine nerpa wait moscow river survivor safety sergei show man microwave device vika natalie anne apartment gather supply submarine journey alien sense outside faraday cage give chase anne hesitate follow vika go way cause natalie follow inside apartment natalie unable close door alien get inside sergei shoot alien gun find stunned alien kill sergei fire escape anne hesitates kill try escape natalie set apartment fire climb meet vika meet russian police team improvise armor lead boris manage wound alien conventional weapon sean collect piece alien body small police band able build faraday cage russian state library boris man eventually agree help remain submarine policeman believe alien strip mining conductive metal giant light column see drill moscow subway alien discover escape track vika hide pillar unable join see ben help climb track kill alien survivor powerless patrol boat river drift downstream wait submarine boat near submarine run aground attempt push free new light beam destroy large apartment building right river cause boat capsize sean policeman swim submarine reach discover natalie miss flare fire natalie flare gun railway bus yard near river sean determined possibly miss chance escape policeman agree help rescue russian submarine crew express doubt rescue assist build microwave gun strong battery team manage destroy alien sean find natalie bus policeman vika destroy alien microwave gun water sean bus natalie alien climb board lock door send bus speeding bus yard grab natalie leg sean blast alien shield microwave gun discover alien weakness throw piece wound alien collect early destroy unshielded alien stop bus narrowly avoid collision return submarine police team decide stay fight city boris tell war begin sean natalie vika plan spread learn alien microwave gun vulnerability piece dead alien rest world sean natalie survivor original group vika nearly share kiss submarine pre credit scene submarine cruise caspian sea learn survivor paris manage destroy alien mining tower

Evelyn,drama,"Nine-year-old Evelyn Doyle (Sophie Vavasseur) and her two brothers, Maurice (Hugh MacDonagh) and Dermot (Niall Beagan) are motherless when their mother abandons the marriage to a drunkard out-of-work father Desmond Doyle (Pierce Brosnan). When Desmond's mother-in-law (Claire Mullan) reports the situation to the Irish authorities, a judge decides the children are prohibited by law to being left in broken homes; they are placed in Church-run orphanages.
Evelyn's grandfather (Frank Kelly) takes her to the girls orphanage and explains to her that rays of light created by the sun shining in a specific spot through the clouds are called ""angel rays""; they indicate that a guardian angel is watching over her. Evelyn finds when she enters the orphanage that conditions are harsh and many have been there for years.
Desmond finds little hope in regaining custody of his children because he cannot afford a lawyer, turns to drink and assaults Father O'Malley. The father punches Desmond. Desmond is helped by the local part-time bartender and chemist, Bernadette (Julianna Margulies). Bernadette tells Desmond to go for help at her brother Michael's (Stephen Rea) office, a solicitor. He makes it clear to Desmond that he cannot help him until he gets his act together—regular income and orderly life. Desmond finds decorating jobs and spends nights singing for tips with his father in the pub where Bernadette works.
Desmond reads in a letter of Evelyn that she has not been adjusting well with Sister Bridget (Andrea Irvine) who beat her when the Sister's authority was questioned. Evelyn objected to Sister Bridget beating her friend who forgot Bible scripture, although the Bible scripture stated that ""God is merciful"" therefore God would not want Sister Bridget to beat the children for forgetting scripture. While seeking out Evelyn, he finds and shakes the Sister while threatening her never to touch his daughter again or he will ""tear her limb from limb.""
Desmond returns to drink and after several rampages Bernadette refuses to continue her relationship with him since he needs to shape up. Desmond reforms. The American Nick Barron (Aidan Quinn), and the injured rugby player and rebel lawyer Thomas Connolly (Alan Bates) argue Desmond's court plea for regaining custody of his children; it is rejected and no course of appeal until they decide to bring before the plea is rejected by the courts leading Desmond and his children heartbroken and separated. But, that night (the same night Desmond quits drinking) a gambler rigs Desmond to win copious amounts of money to pay for his legal bills. With nowhere to go though, the case seems hopeless until Connolly comes up with the idea of bringing an entirely new issue to the Supreme Court that the lack of the children's custody by a parent is contrary to the Irish Constitution—an issue never successfully argued before the Court.
It takes public pressure for the case to be heard before the Court. Desmond gives compelling testimony. The following day, Evelyn says in court that she told a false story about her bruised face because Sister Bridget exaggerated her interaction with Desmond. Evelyn works herself into a pickle when Angel rays come into the court through the windows—a sign to her that her grandfather was watching over her. She recants her newly expressed explanation with comebacks that make people chuckle. She then finishes it off with a recitation of a prayer asking to forgive Sister Bridget and ensure the prospering of Ireland and its people. Two of the three judges side with Desmond, the children are returned to him and he falls in love with Bernadette. They are shown on Christmas Day, celebrating as a family. It is this court action that many children in Irish orphanages were returned to their parents after the Irish Children's Act is amended.",drama year old evelyn doyle sophie vavasseur brother maurice hugh macdonagh dermot niall beagan motherless mother abandon marriage drunkard work father desmond doyle pierce brosnan desmond mother law claire mullan report situation irish authority judge decide child prohibit law leave broken home place church run orphanage evelyn grandfather frank kelly take girl orphanage explain ray light create sun shine specific spot cloud call angel ray indicate guardian angel watch evelyn find enter orphanage condition harsh year desmond find little hope regain custody child afford lawyer turn drink assault father father punch desmond desmond help local time bartender chemist bernadette julianna margulie bernadette tell desmond help brother michael stephen rea office solicitor make clear desmond help get act regular income orderly life desmond find decorate job spend night singe tip father pub bernadette work desmond read letter evelyn adjust sister bridget andrea irvine beat sister authority question evelyn object sister bridget beat friend forget bible scripture bible scripture state god merciful god want sister bridget beat child forget scripture seek evelyn find shake sister threaten touch daughter tear limb limb desmond return drink rampage bernadette refuse continue relationship need shape desmond reform american nick barron aidan quinn injure rugby player rebel lawyer thomas connolly alan bates argue desmond court plea regain custody child reject course appeal decide bring plea reject court lead desmond child heartbroken separate night night desmond quit drink gambler rig desmond win copious amount money pay legal bill case hopeless connolly come idea bring entirely new issue supreme court lack child custody parent contrary irish constitution issue successfully argue court take public pressure case hear court desmond give compelling testimony follow day evelyn say court tell false story bruised face sister bridget exaggerate interaction desmond evelyn work pickle angel ray come court window sign grandfather watch recant newly express explanation comeback people chuckle finish recitation prayer ask forgive sister bridget ensure prospering ireland people judge desmond child return fall love bernadette show christmas day celebrate family court action child irish orphanage return parent irish child act amend

Blind,thriller,"A missing person case involving a female university student and the victim in a hit and run case appears to be related. Detectives look for a witness.
Min Soo-ah (Kim Ha-neul) used to be a promising cadet at the police academy but after a horrific car accident which killed her surrogate brother Dong-hyun (Park Bo-gum) and caused her to lose her eyesight, her police career ended. Soo-ah reveals to Detective Jo (Jo Hee-bong) at the police station that on the night of the hit and run case she was picked up by a taxi cab driver. Soo-ah believes the taxi driver may be the perpetrator of the crimes. Initially, Detective Jo doesn't take Soo-ah's claims seriously because she is blind, but when Soo-ah displays her acute senses, the detective starts to believe her.
Detective Jo and Soo-ah then work together to find the taxi cab driver, but all their leads turn up empty. Then another witness comes forward, Kwon Gi-seob (Yoo Seung-ho). Gi-seob is a motorcycle delivery boy who claims to have also witnessed the hit and run incident. Gi-seob emphatically states that the car in question was not a taxi cab, but rather an imported sedan.
Meanwhile, Soo-ah finds herself being stalked by a mysterious man who turns out to be the killer, gynecologist Myung-jin (Yang Young-jo). Soo-ah, while in the car with him, remembered that he had a strong scent, he had a watch on his right hand, and he gave her an iced coffee drink in a glass can. While in the car with him, they hit a bump while in an argument. The body of the dead university student rolls out of the trunk and Myung-jin gets out to examine it. When Soo-ah goes out as well to inspect the damage done, he claims that he hit a dog, but she reasons with him, starting another fight. He leaves her in the rain when another car comes. The reason why she was in the car with him is because she needed a ride back from visiting the orphanage she used to grow up in.
One night when Gi-seob is walking home alone, he is followed by Myung-jin. Gi-seob at first runs away, but is snuck up on and hit by a brick. An ambulance comes and Detective Jo and Soo-ah drive to the scene. Gi-seob gets annoyed by Soo-ah's constant nagging, and on the day of his release, storms out in anger. When he reaches the nearly-empty subway station, he sees Soo-ah on the other side and then sees her ride the subway followed by the killer. He calls her on her phone and tells her urgently that the killer is in front of her. As he runs to catch up with her, she goes on FaceTime and shows him her location and surroundings. He guides her out of the subway and to safety, as well as her seeing eye dog, Seul-gi. She reaches into her handbag and sprays the killer's eyes with her pepper spray and runs off with Seul-gi. When she reaches the elevator, she thought that she'd be safe, but the killer quickly gets in and kills Seul-gi.
When Soo-ah wakes up, she asks for her seeing dog, but Gi-seob hands her the blood-stained leash. At home she gets a call from an unknown number. The caller warns her away from the case. ""You can't see me, but I'm watching you."" A few days later, Detective Jo finds the killer. They get into a violent fight, in which the detective dies and the killer drives off. Meanwhile, Gi-seob and Soo-ah visit the orphanage again when they're asked to watch over it while the school director takes the children out. The killer enters the living room and lights a cigarette and listens to some music. Soo-ah, annoyed by the music, goes downstairs to turn it off. She reprimands Gi-seob for playing it, but smells the cigarette smoke.

As the working day concludes, businesswomen Mary Ann Marshall and Renni are the last two daytime employees to leave the skyscraper, but on their way out they discover that all of the exits are sealed, and that all of the telephones are dead.

Funeral Home,horror,"At the beginning of the summer, Heather arrives in a small unnamed town to stay with her grandmother, Maude Chalmers, whose house—a former funeral home—has recently been converted into an inn. Maude's husband, James, an undertaker, has been missing for several years, and she has been forced to make a living selling artificial flower arrangements in town; she hopes to supplant her income by opening the home to traveling guests. Billy Hibbs, a mentally-challenged man, lives with Maude as the property handyman.
Nearby, a farmer named Sam reports an abandoned vehicle discovered on his property, which is traced to a missing real estate developer who had been surveying the area. At the inn on the evening of Heather's arrival, guests Harry Browning and his mistress Florie check in. When Maude realizes the couple are unmarried, she asks them to leave, but they refuse. That evening after having drinks, they drive to a local quarry recommended by Heather; while there, Maude's truck arrives, smashing the back of their car and pushing them into the water below, where they both drown. The same night, Heather goes on a date with Rick, a local teenager, and returns home to hear her Maude speaking to an unseen man in the basement. When she inquires, Maude denies it.
The next day, while Maude is in town, Rick stops by the house. He tells Heather that her grandfather, James, was a known alcoholic, and recounts a story from his childhood in which Mr. Chalmers had locked he and a friend in the funeral home's basement to scare them. The two explore the property while Maude is gone; in the garage, they discover Mr. Chalmer's Cadillac hearse, and Heather finds a necklace with the initials ""H.D."" engraved on it. That evening, Heather again hears Maude speaking to someone in the basement, this time arguing with a male voice about a woman named ""Helena Davis."" Heather discovers Helena has been missing for some time, and was rumored to be have eloped with her grandfather. Mr. Davis, Helena's husband, arrives at the house to ask Maude about the alleged affair, which she denies ever occurred. Later that evening, Mr. Davis is murdered with a pickaxe.
The following day while Heather and Rick are swimming in the quarry, Florie and Harry's bodies are discovered. Heather confides in Rick that she believes her grandmother is hiding someone in the basement. That evening, they return to the house. Upon finding that Maude is not home, the two decide to explore the basement. There they discover Billy's corpse, and are attacked by Maude, who, imitating her husband's voice, scolds Heather for coming into the basement. Maude attempts to kill Heather with an axe and she flees through the basement, discovering a hidden room where her James's corpse rests in a bed of Maude's artificial flowers. Just as Maude is about to strike Heather with the axe, she lapses out of her dissociative identity. The police arrive at the scene in the basement, and Joe asks Maude if they can talk about what has occurred. She agrees, so long as she can prepare a cup of tea.
Later, Joe, a local police officer, explains to a news reporter that Maude had murdered James and Helena, his mistress, after discovering their affair. After, she preserved James's corpse, and buried both Helena and Mr. Davis in the local graveyard.",horror beginning summer heather arrive small unnamed town stay grandmother maude chalmer house funeral home recently convert inn maude husband james undertaker miss year force living sell artificial flower arrangement town hope supplant income open home travel guest billy hibbs mentally challenge man live maude property handyman nearby farmer name sam report abandon vehicle discover property trace miss real estate developer survey area inn evening heather arrival guest harry brown mistress florie check maude realize couple unmarried ask leave refuse evening have drink drive local quarry recommend heather maude truck arrive smash car push water drown night heather go date rick local teenager return home hear maude speak unseen man basement inquire maude deny day maude town rick stop house tell heather grandfather james know alcoholic recount story childhood mr chalmer lock friend funeral home basement scare explore property maude go garage discover mr chalmer cadillac hearse heather find necklace initial engrave evening heather hear maude speak basement time argue male voice woman name helena davis heather discover helena miss time rumor elope grandfather mr davis helena husband arrive house ask maude alleged affair deny occur later evening mr davis murder pickaxe follow day heather rick swim quarry florie harry body discover heather confide rick believe grandmother hide basement evening return house find maude home decide explore basement discover billy corpse attack maude imitate husband voice scold heather come basement maude attempt kill heather axe flee basement discover hide room jame corpse rest bed maude artificial flower maude strike heather axe lapse dissociative identity police arrive scene basement joe ask maude talk occur agree long prepare cup tea later joe local police officer explain news reporter maude murder james helena mistress discover affair preserve james corpse bury helena mr davis local graveyard
Brokeback Mountain,"western, romantic drama","In 1963, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are hired by Joe Aguirre to herd his sheep through the summer in the Wyoming mountains. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a pass at Ennis, who is initially hesitant but eventually responds to Jack's advances. Despite Ennis telling Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a passionate sexual and emotional relationship. After Jack and Ennis eventually part ways, Ennis marries his longtime fiancée Alma Beers and has two daughters with her. Jack returns the next summer seeking work, but Aguirre, who observed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, refuses to rehire him.
Jack moves to Texas, where he meets, marries, and has a son with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome. After four years, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting, the two kiss passionately, and Alma inadvertently observes this. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life together on a small ranch, but Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of two men suspected of homosexual behavior, refuses. He is also unwilling to abandon his family. Ennis and Jack continue to meet for infrequent fishing trips. The marriages of both men deteriorate. Lureen abandons the rodeo, going into business with her father and expecting Jack to work in sales. Alma and Ennis eventually divorce in 1975. Hearing about Ennis' divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming. He suggests again that they should live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in Mexico. Ennis sees his family regularly until Alma finally confronts him about her knowing the true nature of his relationship with Jack. This results in a violent argument, causing Ennis to abandon his connections with Alma. Ennis meets and has a brief romantic relationship with Cassie Cartwright, a waitress.
Jack and Lureen meet and befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone. It is implied that Jack begins an affair with Randall, as Randall tells Jack his boss has a remote cabin that he can use anytime he wants, and suggests they use it together sometime. At the end of a regular fishing trip with Jack, Ennis tries to delay their next meeting. Jack's frustration erupts into argument, and Ennis blames Jack for being the cause of his own conflicted actions. Ennis begins to cry. Jack tries to hold him and there is a brief struggle, but they end up locked in an embrace. Jack watches as Ennis drives away. Some time later, Ennis receives a postcard he had sent to Jack, stamped ""Deceased"". He calls Lureen, who says that Jack died in an accident, when a tire he was changing exploded. As she is speaking, Ennis imagines that Jack was actually beaten to death by a gang of thugs, the fate that Ennis feared. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, but she does not know where it is.
Ennis travels to meet with Jack's mother and father, and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Permitted by Jack's mother to see his childhood bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt he thought he had lost on Brokeback Mountain. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own stained shirt from that summer's fight. Ennis holds both shirts up to his face, silently weeping. Jack's mother lets him keep the shirts. Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell her father she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fiancé really loves her and she replies ""yes"". After Alma leaves, Ennis goes to his closet, where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. He stares at the ensemble for a moment, tears in his eyes, and murmurs, ""Jack, I swear...""",western romantic drama ennis del mar jack twist hire joe aguirre herd sheep summer wyoming mountain night heavy drinking jack make pass enni initially hesitant eventually respond jack advance despite enni tell jack time incident develop passionate sexual emotional relationship jack enni eventually way ennis marry longtime fiancée alma beer daughter jack return summer seek work aguirre observe jack enni mountain refuse rehire jack move texas meet marrie son rodeo rider lureen newsome year jack visit ennis meeting kiss passionately alma inadvertently observe jack broach subject create life small ranch enni haunt childhood memory torture murder man suspect homosexual behavior refuse unwilling abandon family ennis jack continue meet infrequent fishing trip marriage man deteriorate lureen abandon rodeo go business father expect jack work sale alma enni eventually divorce hear enni divorce jack drive wyoming suggest live ennis refuse away child jack find solace male prostitute mexico ennis see family regularly alma finally confront know true nature relationship jack result violent argument cause enni abandon connection alma enni meet brief romantic relationship cassie cartwright waitress jack lureen meet befriend couple randall lashawn malone imply jack begin affair randall randall tell jack boss remote cabin use anytime want suggest use end regular fishing trip jack enni try delay meeting jack frustration erupt argument ennis blame jack cause conflicted action enni begin cry jack try hold brief struggle end lock embrace jack watch enni drive away time later ennis receive postcard send jack stamp deceased call lureen say jack die accident tire change explode speak ennis imago jack actually beat death gang thug fate enni fear lureen tell enni jack want ashe scatter brokeback mountain know enni travel meet jack mother father offer jack ashe mountain father refuse prefer inter family plot permit jack mother childhood bedroom enni find bloodstained shirt think lose brokeback mountain discover jack keep hang stained shirt summer fight ennis hold shirt face silently weep jack mother let shirt later year old alma jr arrive ennis trailer tell father engage ask blessing invite wedding enni ask fiancé love reply yes alma leave enni go closet jack shirt hang postcard brokeback mountain tack stare ensemble moment tear eye murmur jack swear
Operation: Rabbit,animated short,"Set in the desert, Operation: Rabbit opens with Wile E. Coyote running up to Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole and constructing a door. He knocks on the door and Bugs, slightly bemused by the addition to his property, opens it. The Coyote proclaims, in his very first spoken line of dialogue ever, that he is a genius, as well as being faster, taller, and stronger than Bugs, and that he intends to eat the rabbit. He goes on to advise Bugs that it is futile to try and escape, since Bugs ""could hardly pass the entrance examinations to kindergarten"", an insult that seems to bore Bugs. (Wile E. displays an enlarged self-confidence throughout not only this film but also in other appearances with Bugs, aside from Hare-Breadth Hurry.) An unimpressed Bugs replies, ""I'm sorry, Mac, the lady of the house ain't home. And besides, we mailed you people a check last week,"" then slams the door in Wile E.'s face. The Coyote goes back to his cave hideout (taking the door with him), asking himself: ""Why do they always want to do it the hard way?""
The Coyote's first plan to trap Bugs is to build a pressure cooker on top of the rabbit hole and cook Bugs alive. He chops up vegetables, throws them down the hole, adds an egg, a drop of cooking oil, some seasoning, tosses it into a salad, then places the pressure cooker on top. Bugs watches Wile E.'s work from another hole (suggesting his burrow has a back door), then walks up to him and asks ""What's cookin', Doc?"" When Wile E. informs him that ""rabbit stew"" is cooking (""Gad, I'm SUCH a genius!""), Bugs casually observes, ""There's only one little thing wrong with it"", that there is no rabbit. As Wile E. frantically looks under the cooker, Bugs gives him a big kick down the hole and sticks the cooker on top of him. Bugs then picks up a bat, goes back down the second hole, singing, and clobbers the Coyote (off-screen), prompting Wile E., with a huge lump on his head, to remark: ""Well, back to the old drawing board.""
In the next scene, the Coyote prepares his second plan: the use of a chute for firing a cannonball into Bugs' hole. After the ball arrives in the hole via a cannon and that chute, Bugs uses a second chute to return the ball, where it explodes on target, causing the plan to quite literally backfire on Wile E.
Bugs then goes to Wile E.'s cave to claim that he is surrendering ""on account of I cannot fight no more against such genius,"" but he wants Wile E. to sign as a witness to his last will and testament. He gives the Coyote the document and a ""pen"", which is really a burning stick of dynamite. Wile E. pretends to be fooled, but puts out the fuse when Bugs hands over the dynamite (""Very amateurish attempt on my person""). While he gloats (""Being a genius certainly has its advantages""), it is revealed that there is another fuse at the other end of the TNT stick, which explodes on cue.
The Coyote returns to his cave and builds a mechanical (and explosive) lady rabbit that will be used as a decoy to trap Bugs. (""Brilliance. That's all I can say. Sheer, unadulterated brilliance!"") Bugs, already anticipating this plan, builds an explosive lady coyote in response (""Fight fire with fire, I always say""). Bugs detonates the coyote robot just as Wile E. is romantically embracing it in his cave. With this distraction, Wile E. completely forgets about the rabbit robot (""Oh, NO...""), which, as he is in the process of trying to throw it out, also blows up in the cave.
The Coyote then creates an exploding flying saucer with a radarscope mechanism able to detect birds, mice, and rabbits. The disc flies to Bugs' hole, but Bugs thwarts it by putting on a chicken mask. The disguised Bugs then adds ""COYOTE"" to the radarscope's target options and moves the dial there. The saucer speeds back to Wile E., blowing the entire mountain to smithereens.
The Coyote makes one last plan: While admiring his self-status as a ""Super Genius,"" he fills a series of carrots with explosive liquid nitroglycerin inside the explosives shack of a construction site. Bugs, using a tractor, drags the shack to the desert's railroad track and deposits it on the tracks. As Wile E. completes his preparations, a train can be seen approaching. As a train whistle sounds, the Coyote turns to a window to see the train bearing down on him, and futilely pulls down a window shade. When the train hits the shack, all of the explosives in the shack detonate. ""'Wile E. Coyote - Super Genius'"", the painfully burned Coyote groans in self-sarcasm while holding a tree branch on the edge of a cliff as the train chugs away below undamaged.
Wile E., still dazed and covered in ash, returns to Bugs' hole, rebuilds his door, knocks on it and admits defeat. ""Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mud"", he says to Bugs before passing out. In response, Bugs says, ""And remember, MUD spelled backwards is DUM"" (dumb) (a parody of the slogan for Serutan laxatives, ""Serutan spelled backwards is 'natures'"").",animate short set desert operation rabbit open wile coyote run bugs bunny rabbit hole construct door knock door bug slightly bemuse addition property open coyote proclaim speak line dialogue genius fast tall strong bug intend eat rabbit go advise bug futile try escape bug hardly pass entrance examination kindergarten insult bore bug wile display enlarged self confidence film appearance bug aside hare breadth hurry unimpressed bug reply sorry mac lady house be home mail people check week slam door wile face coyote go cave hideout take door ask want hard way coyote plan trap bug build pressure cooker rabbit hole cook bug alive chop vegetable throw hole add egg drop cook oil seasoning toss salad place pressure cooker bug watch wile work hole suggest burrow door walk ask cookin doc wile inform rabbit stew cook gad genius bug casually observe little thing wrong rabbit wile frantically look cooker bug give big kick hole stick cooker bug pick bat go second hole singing clobber coyote screen prompt wile huge lump head remark old drawing board scene coyote prepare second plan use chute fire cannonball bug hole ball arrive hole cannon chute bug use second chute return ball explode target cause plan literally backfire wile bug go wile cave claim surrender account fight genius want wile sign witness testament give coyote document pen burn stick dynamite wile pretend fool put fuse bug hand dynamite amateurish attempt person gloat genius certainly advantage reveal fuse end tnt stick explode cue coyote return cave build mechanical explosive lady rabbit decoy trap bug brilliance sheer unadulterated brilliance bug anticipate plan build explosive lady coyote response fight fire fire bug detonate coyote robot wile romantically embrace cave distraction wile completely forget rabbit robot oh process try throw blow cave coyote create explode flying saucer radarscope mechanism able detect bird mouse rabbit disc fly bug hole bug thwart put chicken mask disguised bug add coyote radarscope target option move dial saucer speed wile blow entire mountain smithereen coyote make plan admire self status super genius fill series carrot explosive liquid nitroglycerin inside explosive shack construction site bug tractor drag shack desert railroad track deposit track wile complete preparation train see approach train whistle sound coyote turn window train bear futilely pull window shade train hit shack explosive shack detonate wile coyote super genius painfully burn coyote groan self sarcasm hold tree branch edge cliff train chug away undamaged wile daze cover ash return bug hole rebuild door knock admit defeat allow introduce mud say bug pass response bug say remember mud spell backwards dum dumb parody slogan serutan laxatives serutan spell backwards nature
Beauty for Sale,drama,"Small town girl Letty Lawson (Madge Evans) moves to New York City and lives in a boarding house run by Mrs. Merrick (May Robson). Eventually she asks her friend and Mrs. Merrick's daughter, Carol (Una Merkel), to get her a job at her workplace, an exclusive beauty salon owned by Madame Sonia Barton (Hedda Hopper). Though both Carol and her brother Bill (Edward J. Nugent), who is in love with her, warn her that it is not a fit place for a young woman of good character, Letty insists she knows what she is getting into.
After proving herself, Letty is sent on a house call to attend to spoiled, scatterbrained, chatty Mrs. Sherwood (Alice Brady). When she leaves, she discovers her hat has been chewed up by Mrs. Smallwood's Pekingese. Lawyer Mr. Sherwood (Otto Kruger) returns home and is quite fond of Letty and offers her to go and buy her an expensive replacement. By chance, she meets him again when they both seek shelter from a rainstorm in the same place. Smallwood is delighted when a fear of lightning makes Letty reflexively seek the comfort of his arms several times. They start seeing each other, though nothing very improper occurs.
Meanwhile, Carol has a rich, older, indulgent boyfriend, Freddy Gordon (Charley Grapewin), while Jane (Florine McKinney), another salon employee, is secretly seeing Burt (Phillips Holmes), Madame Sonia's mining engineer son.
Finally, Sherwood asks Letty to take the next step in their relationship. She asks for a week to think it over.
Carol convinces Freddy to take her along on his business trip to Paris. While seeing her off aboard the ocean liner, Letty runs into the Bartons. When Letty later mentions that Burt is leaving on the same ship as Carol, Jane becomes very upset. It turns out that Burt had promised to marry her the next day after she told him she was pregnant. Though Letty tries to comfort her, late that night Jane leaps from her window to her death.
Influenced by the examples of both Jane and Carol (after her first and only love turned out to be a married man who eventually went back to his wife, she became calculating and cynical), Letty turns Sherwood down. Then, she reluctantly agrees to marry Bill.
Specifically requested by Mrs. Sherwood, Letty is forced by Madame Sonia to go to her home. When her client notices her engagement ring, she reveals that she is getting married soon. Mr. Sherwood coolly congratulates her. However, on the wedding day, she cannot go through with it.
The next day, Mrs. Sherwood asks her husband for a divorce so she can marry Robert Abbott (John Roche), the architect of the new country mansion she had commissioned. She tells him that she will ask for no alimony, as she is independently wealthy. Sherwood is furious, as it is after Letty's supposed wedding, but is quite willing to let his wife go.
Carol, having finally gotten Freddy to propose, goes house hunting. The real estate agent takes them to see the Sherwood mansion. When he reveals that it is being sold because the couple are divorcing, Letty rushes over to the real estate office to stop the sale and be reunited with her love.",drama small town girl letty lawson madge evans move new york city live boarding house run mrs merrick robson eventually ask friend mrs merrick daughter carol una merkel job workplace exclusive beauty salon own madame sonia barton hedda hopper carol brother bill edward nugent love warn fit place young woman good character letty insist know get prove letty send house attend spoil scatterbraine chatty mrs sherwood alice brady leave discover hat chew mrs smallwood pekingese lawyer mr sherwood otto kruger return home fond letty offer buy expensive replacement chance meet seek shelter rainstorm place smallwood delighted fear lightning make letty reflexively seek comfort arm time start see improper occur carol rich old indulgent boyfriend freddy gordon charley grapewin jane florine mckinney salon employee secretly see burt phillips holmes madame sonia mining engineer son finally sherwood ask letty step relationship ask week think carol convince freddy business trip paris see aboard ocean liner letty run barton letty later mention burt leave ship carol jane upset turn burt promise marry day tell pregnant letty try comfort late night jane leap window death influence example jane carol love turn married man eventually go wife calculate cynical letty turn sherwood reluctantly agree marry bill specifically request mrs sherwood letty force madame sonia home client notice engagement ring reveal getting marry soon mr sherwood coolly congratulate wedding day day mrs sherwood ask husband divorce marry robert abbott john roche architect new country mansion commission tell ask alimony independently wealthy sherwood furious letty suppose wedding willing let wife carol having finally get freddy propose go house hunting real estate agent take sherwood mansion reveal sell couple divorce letty rush real estate office stop sale reunite love
Bachelor Apartment,comedy,"Wayne Carter is a New York playboy, who pays no attention to the marital status of his many dalliances. However, there are some women whose attention he attempts to avoid, one such being the married Agatha Carraway.
Helene and Lita Andrews are small town girls who have come to the big city in order to find fame and fortune. Helene is much more sensible than her younger sister, Lita, who is a bit flighty. Eventually, Lita believes she has a millionaire interested in her, Carter. When she goes to have dinner at his apartment, an alarmed Helene goes to track her down to prevent anything untoward from occurring. However, upon her arrival, she discovers that Lita has really attracted the attention of Carter's butler, Rollins, with whom she is having dinner.
Carter is entranced with the sensible, earnest Helene. Discovering she is in need of employment, he offers her a job in his office as an executive secretary. She at first refuses, cautious about his intentions, but in need of work, she eventually relents and accepts the position. Their mutual attraction grows, and Carter is seemingly beginning to give up his libidinous liaisons, until one afternoon when Carter asks her over to his apartment, not on a personal level, but to take some dictation. Again leery, she agrees and meets him at his apartment, and all is going well until the flirtatious Agatha shows up at the apartment. When her husband shows up shortly after, and Agatha hides in the bedroom while the two men have a discussion about marital issues, Helene once again becomes disenchanted with Carter, and resigns her position.
Realizing that he is truly in love with Helene, Carter is relentless in attempting to convince her of his sincerity, and of his deep feelings for her. Eventually, she comes to believe him, and agrees to meet him at his apartment. Unfortunately, Agatha is also relentless, and shows up once again. This time, when her husband shows up slightly later, he is armed and threatens Carter, since he knows his wife is hiding in the bedroom. To save Carter, Helene, who was with Agatha in the bedroom, exits, and swears that she is the only woman in the apartment. Mollified, Carraway leaves. After Agatha also departs, Carter is relieved and thinks everything is all right, but Helene is upset over the entire episode, and leaves deeply upset.
Carter is distraught, thinking he has lost the woman he loves. Helene rebuffs all of his attempts to win her back. Nothing works, until Lita runs off to live in sin with a musical producer, Lee Graham.

Happily Ever After,animated,"The film starts as the Looking Glass recaps the story of ""Snow White."" The wicked Queen has been vanquished and the kingdom is at peace as Snow White and the Prince prepare to marry. Meanwhile, back at the castle, the Queen's animal like minions are celebrating their freedom by throwing a party for themselves. Then, the Queen's equally evil wizard brother, Lord Maliss, arrives at the castle, wondering where his sister is. After learning about his sister's demise, he vows to avenge her death. In the process, he transforms into a wyvern and decides to take control of the palace, while Scowl, (a red colored owl) starts training his companion, a purple bat named Batso, on how to be evil.
The next day, Snow White and the Prince are in the meadow picking flowers for their wedding, when suddenly Lord Maliss, in his dragon form, begins attacking Snow White and the Prince as they are traveling to the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. He targets the Prince, but Snow White manages to flee.
Snow White reaches the cottage and meets the Dwarves' female cousins, the Seven ""Dwarfelles"": Muddy, Sunburn, Blossom, Marina, Critterina, Moonbeam, and Thunderella. The Dwarves have left the cottage after they bought another mine in a different kingdom, but the Dwarfelles gladly assist Snow White, taking her to visit Mother Nature at Rainbow Falls. Mother Nature has given the Dwarfelles individual powers to assist her; she holds Thunderella accountable for not being able to master her powers correctly, and accuses the other Dwarfelles of improperly using their powers, and threatens to take them away as punishment. Lord Maliss attacks them, but Mother Nature shoots him with lightning, causing him to crash and return to his human form. Before leaving, Lord Maliss informs Snow White that the Prince is held captive in his castle.
Snow White and the Dwarfelles travel to Lord Maliss' castle in the Realm of Doom, along the way encountering a strange cloaked humanoid known as the ""Shadow Man."" Lord Maliss sends his one-horned wolves after the group, and they manage to escape with the help of the ""Shadow Man."" Lord Maliss is furious at this failure and transforms into his dragon form, finally capturing Snow White successfully himself and taking her to the castle. The Dwarfelles follow them and sneak into the castle as well.
In the castle, Snow White is reunited with her Prince, who begins exhibiting strange behaviors, and takes her through a secret passage to supposedly escape. When Snow White realizes that he's not the real Prince but is actually Lord Maliss in disguise, he attempts to throw a magical red cloak on Snow White to petrify her into stone. He almost succeeds, but is attacked by the ""Shadow Man."" The Dwarfelles arrive and attack Lord Maliss as well, but fail and become petrified themselves. The only one unharmed is Thunderella, who finally regains control of her powers and assists Snow White to subdue Lord Maliss. The cloak is thrown on him and Lord Maliss is petrified in mid-transition between his human and dragon form.
As the sun shines onto the castle, the Dwarfelles are restored back to their normal selves. Snow White tearfully mourns the ""Shadow Man"", believing that she lost both him and her Prince, until Mother Nature arrives at the scene. Suddenly, the ""Shadow Man"" wakes up and he turns out to be the Prince; as he is waking up he begins comforting Snow White, telling her not to cry, and she notices that he is back to his normal self. The Prince reveals that Lord Maliss had cast a spell on him and he has been watching over Snow White during her journey, guarding her with his life.
Mother Nature decides to let the Dwarfelles keep their powers because they have finally proven themselves by working together as one, and she allows them to attend Snow White's wedding. In the end, Mother Nature takes in Batso and Scowl to be trained as her new apprentices.

Orlando,fantasy,"The story begins in the Elizabethan era, shortly before the death of Queen Elizabeth I. On her deathbed, the Queen promises an androgynous young nobleman named Orlando a large tract of land and a castle built on it, along with a generous monetary gift; both Orlando and his heirs would keep the land and inheritance forever, but Elizabeth will bequeath it to him only if he assents to an unusual command: ""Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old."" Orlando acquiesces and reposes in splendid isolation in the castle for a couple of centuries, during which time he dabbles in poetry and art. His attempts to befriend a celebrated poet, however, backfire when the poet ridicules his verse. Orlando then travels to Constantinople as English ambassador to the Turks, and is almost killed in a diplomatic fracas. Waking up the next morning, he learns something startling: he has transformed into a woman.
The now Lady Orlando comes home to her estate in Middle-Eastern attire, only to learn that she faces several impending lawsuits arguing that Orlando was a woman all along and therefore has no right to the land or any of the royal inheritance that the Queen had promised. The succeeding two centuries tire Orlando out; the court case, bad luck in love, and the wars of British history eventually bring the story to the present day (i.e., the early 1990s). Orlando now has a young daughter in tow and is in search of a publisher for her book. (The literary editor who judges the work as ""quite good"" is portrayed by the late Heathcote Williams—the same actor who played the poet who had, earlier in the film, denigrated Orlando's poetry.) Having lived a most bizarre existence, Orlando, relaxing with her daugher and daydreaming philiosophically under a tree, has finally found a tranquil niche.
Director Sally Potter described her approach to the adaptation as follows:
The film contains some anachronisms not present in the novel. For example, upon Orlando's arrival in Constantinople in about the year 1700, England is referred to as a ""green and pleasant land"", a line from William Blake's Jerusalem, which in reality was not written until 1804.[8] Also, Orlando receives a gift to celebrate the new century from Queen Anne, who had in fact not yet succeeded to the throne.
Potter argued that ""whereas the novel could withstand abstraction and arbitrariness (such as Orlando's change of sex), cinema is more pragmatic.""[1]:14 She continued,
At film's end, Orlando has a daughter, whereas in the novel she had a son.[1]:15 Potter has said that she intended Orlando's breaking the fourth wall to be an equivalent to Woolf's direct addresses to her readers,[a] and that this was her attempt at converting Woolf's literary wit into a more 'cinematic' humor.[1]:15 One obvious similarity remained, however: the film ends in its present day, 1992,[1]:15[b] just as Woolf's novel ends in its present day, 1928.[9]",fantasy story begin elizabethan era shortly death queen elizabeth deathbed queen promise androgynous young nobleman name orlando large tract land castle build generous monetary gift orlando heir land inheritance forever elizabeth bequeath assent unusual command fade wither grow old orlando acquiesce repose splendid isolation castle couple century time dabble poetry art attempt befriend celebrated poet backfire poet ridicule verse orlando travel constantinople english ambassador turk kill diplomatic fracas wake morning learn startling transform woman lady orlando come home estate middle eastern attire learn face impending lawsuit argue orlando woman right land royal inheritance queen promise succeed century tire orlando court case bad luck love war british history eventually bring story present day early orlando young daughter tow search publisher book literary editor judge work good portray late heathcote williams actor play poet early film denigrate orlando poetry having live bizarre existence orlando relax daugher daydream philiosophically tree finally find tranquil niche director sally potter describe approach adaptation follow film contain anachronism present novel example orlando arrival constantinople year england refer green pleasant land line william blake jerusalem reality write orlando receive gift celebrate new century queen anne fact succeed throne potter argue novel withstand abstraction arbitrariness orlando change sex cinema pragmatic continue film end orlando daughter novel potter say intend orlando break fourth wall equivalent woolf direct address attempt convert woolf literary wit cinematic obvious similarity remain film end present day woolf novel end present day
Oklahoma!,musical,"Curly rides his horse through the cornfield. He arrives at Aunt Eller's farm. Laurey Williams is Aunt Eller's niece, with whom Curly is in love. Laurey clearly feels the same way, but is loath to admit it. Curly has come to ask her to a party that night, but Laurey is offended that Curly has waited until the morning of the party to ask her. To make him jealous, she agrees to go with Jud, Aunt Eller's surly hired hand, though she is afraid of him.
Aunt Eller meets roving cowboy Will Parker at the station, who has just returned from Kansas City, and is hoping to marry Ado Annie. Meanwhile, Laurey meets up with Ado Annie, who is with another man, a traveling salesman named Ali Hakim. Laurey reminds her that Will Parker is returning from Kansas. Ado Annie is in a dilemma, unable to decide between Will and Ali. She explains to Laurey that she can never resist a romantic man, though she knows it is wrong.
Will is reunited with Ado Annie, and meets Ali Hakim, unaware that he has been spending time with Ado Annie. He reminds Ado Annie that her father has agreed to let him marry her in exchange for $50. He has managed to earn $50 – but has spent it all on presents for Ado Annie. She initially tries to resist, but Will wins her over.
Several local families arrive at Aunt Eller's ranch to prepare for the party that night. When Gertie flirts with Curly, he is uninterested, but uses the flirtation to make Laurey jealous. Laurey is hurt, but, as she and the other girls freshen up for the party, she tries to convince them, and herself, that she doesn't care.
Ado Annie's father learns that Will has spent all his money, and when Ado Annie introduces Ali, he forces him to propose to her at gun point, though Ali is a rover and has no desire for marriage.
In the orchard, Laurey tells Curly to keep his distance, but Curly is quick to point out that she is as much to blame for the rumours as he is.
Curly asks Laurey if she will go to the party with him instead, and though she clearly wants to, she is too scared of Jud's reaction to turn him down now. In anger, Curly goes to confront Jud about his feelings for Laurey. At first, things seem harmless enough. Curly teases Jud about his reputation, and Jud joins in. But Jud deduces why Curly has come to see him, and angrily threatens both him and Laurey.
As the party draws near, Laurey is miserable. When she uses a bottle of smelling salts bought from Ali, which she was told was a magic elixir, she slips into a trance. In her dream, she and Curly get together and are about to marry, but Jud crashes the wedding and eventually kills Curly. Jud wakes Laurey. Laurey knows Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the party with Jud. Curly, unwilling to go with another young lady to the dance, decides to take Aunt Eller.
Jud has no intention of taking Laurey to the party. He slows down and attempts to sweet-talk her. But when he tries to kiss her, Laurey grabs the whip, and causes the horses to bolt. When they eventually stop, and Jud leaps down, Laurey whips up the horses again and leaves Jud stranded.
The party is in full swing, though the local farmers and cowmen are at loggerheads. Aunt Eller and Mr. Skidmore, the party's host, manage to make peace. Aunt Eller leads an auction of picnic hampers prepared by the local girls. Will has learned that Ali is now engaged to Ado Annie. When Ali learns that Will needs $50 to marry her, he buys the presents Will bought, some for more than twice what they're worth, allowing Will to recover the needed $50. Ado Annie's father is forced to let Will marry his daughter. Meanwhile, Curly and Jud, who has arrived just in time, vie furiously for Laurey's hamper. Curly wins, but not before he has sold his saddle, horse and gun. Jud tries to kill Curly with a ""Little Wonder"" – a kaleidoscope-like device with a dagger concealed inside it – but is foiled by Ali Hakim and Aunt Eller.
Will Parker tells Annie that now that they are engaged, she must stop flirting with other men. Jud confronts Laurey, but she fires him. He says she will never be rid of him. She finds Curly and explains what has happened. Seizing his chance, Curly proposes to her, and she accepts. Ali bids goodbye to Will and Ado Annie and leaves.
Curly and Laurey are married. Gertie arrives at the wedding party, announcing that she is now married. Her husband turns out to be Ali Hakim- Gertie's father forced him to marry her. But the festivities are disrupted by Jud, who sets fire to a haystack and threatens Curly with a knife. Curly jumps on him, and inadvertently causes him to fall on his own knife, killing him.

Victor Victoria,musical comedy,"In 1934 Paris, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant. Afterward her failed audition, Victoria reluctantly returns to her apartment to find herself deciding whether or not to spend her rent money for food. That night, when Richard, Toddy's lover, comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome, Toddy incites a brawl. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria in a restaurant. She invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying, but it escapes and mayhem ensues.
The duo run through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning, Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she kicks him out. Seeing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man and presenting her to Andre Cassell, the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.
Cassell accepts her as Count Victor Grazinski, a gay Polish female impersonator and Toddy's new boyfriend. Cassell gets her a booking in a nightclub show and invites a collection of club owners to the opening. Among the guests is King Marchand, a shady owner of nightclubs in Chicago, and his ditzy moll Norma Cassidy and burly bodyguard Bernstein, a.k.a. Squash. Victor is an immediate hit, and King is smitten, but he is shocked when she is ""revealed"" to be a man at the end of the act. King, however, is convinced that ""Victor"" is not a man.
After a quarrel with Norma, King sends her back to America. Determined to get the truth, King sneaks into Victoria and Toddy's suite and confirms his suspicion when he spies her getting into the bath. He invites Victoria, Toddy, and Cassell to Chez Lui. Another fight breaks out. Squash and Toddy are arrested, along with many of the club clientele, but King and Victoria escape. King kisses Victoria, pretending that he does not care about Victoria's gender, leading them to get together.
Squash returns to the suite and catches King in bed with Victoria. King tries to explain, but then Squash reveals he himself is gay. Meanwhile, Labisse hires a P.I., Charles Bovin, to investigate Victor. Victoria and King live together for a while, but keeping up her deception strains the relationship to the breaking point, and King ends it. Back in Chicago, Norma tells King's partner Sal Andretti that King is having an affair with a man.
At the same time that Victoria has decided to give up the persona of Victor in order to be with King, Sal arrives and demands that King transfer his share of the empire to Sal for a fraction of its worth. Squash tells Victoria what is happening, and she shows Norma that she is really a woman, saving King's stake. That night at the club, Cassell tells Toddy and Victoria that Labisse has lodged a complaint against him and ""Victor"" for perpetrating a fraud. The inspector tells Labisse that the performer is a man and Labisse is an idiot.
In the end, Victoria joins King in the club as her real self. The announcer says that Victor is going to perform, but instead of Victoria, Toddy masquerades as ""Victor"".

It,"horror, fantasy, drama","In October 1988, Bill Denbrough gives his seven-year-old brother, Georgie, a paper sailboat. Georgie sails the boat along the rainy streets of small town Derry, and is disappointed when it falls down a storm drain. As he attempts to retrieve it, Georgie sees a clown in the sewer, who introduces himself as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. The clown entices Georgie to come closer, then severs his arm and drags him into the sewer.
The following summer, Bill and his friends—Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stan Uris—run afoul of older bully Henry Bowers and his gang. Bill, still haunted by Georgie's disappearance and the resulting neglect from his grief-stricken parents, discovers that his brother's body may have washed up in a marshy wasteland called the Barrens. He recruits his friends to investigate, believing his brother may still be alive. Ben Hanscom learns that the town has been plagued by unexplained tragedies and child disappearances for centuries. He is targeted by Bowers' gang, after which he flees into the Barrens and meets Bill's group. They find the sneaker of a missing girl, while a member of the pursuing Bowers Gang, Patrick Hockstetter, is killed by Pennywise while searching the sewers for Ben.
Beverly Marsh, a girl ostracized over rumors of promiscuity, also joins the group; both Bill and Ben develop feelings for her. Later, the group befriends Mike Hanlon after defending him from Bowers. All the while each member of the group has encountered terrifying phenomena in various forms; these include the same menacing clown who attacked Georgie, a headless boy, a fountain of blood, a diseased and rotting man, a creepy painting come to life, Mike's parents burning alive, and a phantom Georgie.
Now calling themselves ""The Losers Club"", they realize they are all being terrorized by the same entity. They determine that ""It"" assumes the appearance of what they fear, awakens every 27 years to feed on the children of Derry before returning to hibernation, and moves about by using sewer lines, which all lead to a well currently under the abandoned house at 29 Neibolt Street. After an attack by Pennywise, the group ventures to the house to confront him, only to be separated and terrorized. Eddie breaks his arm, while Pennywise gloats to Bill about Georgie. As they regroup, Beverly impales Pennywise through the head, forcing the clown to retreat. After the encounter, the group begins to splinter, with only Bill and Beverly resolute in fighting It.
Weeks later, after Beverly confronts and incapacitates her sexually abusive father, she is abducted by Pennywise. The Losers Club reassembles and travels back to the Neibolt house to rescue her. Henry Bowers, who has killed his father after being compelled into madness by It, attacks the group. Mike fights back and pushes Bowers down the well to his apparent death. The Losers descend into the sewers and find It's underground lair, which contains a mountain of decayed circus props and children's belongings, around which the bodies of missing children float in mid-air. Beverly, now catatonic after being exposed to It's true form, is restored to consciousness as Ben kisses her. Bill encounters Georgie, but recognizes that he is Pennywise in disguise. Pennywise attacks the group and takes Bill hostage, offering to spare the others if they let It keep Bill. The Losers reject this and reaffirm their friendship, overcoming their various fears. After a brief battle, they defeat Pennywise and it retreats, with Bill declaring that It will starve during its hibernation. Bill finally accepts his brother's death and is comforted by his friends.
As summer ends, Beverly informs the group of a vision she had while catatonic, where she saw them fighting the creature as adults. The Losers create a blood oath by cutting each other's hands and forming a circle, swearing to return to Derry in adulthood if It returns and destroy the creature once and for all. Stanley, Eddie, Richie, Mike, and Ben make their goodbyes as the group part ways. Beverly tells Bill she is leaving the next day to live with her aunt in Portland.

Wildfire flourishes under the expertise of a ruthless hustler named Patch McGill (Jeff Richards), but his winning streak comes to an abrupt end when his master greedily matches him against a much larger dog; McGill blames Wildfire for the loss, prompting the dog to return to the waterfront.
Fortune strikes when an admirer of Wildfire’s—animal caretaker Jeremiah Nolan (Edmund Gwenn) — brings the dog back to his quarters at a massive countryside estate owned by a self-made millionaire (and dog breeder), Mr. Wyndham, played by Dean Jagger. Bitter over his own failing health, Wyndham initially opposes the presence of the “mongrel,” but his daughter Dorothy (Sally Fraser), recognizes the dog’s beauty and convinces her father to let him stay if he qualifies for a ribbon at a local dog show. Wildfire falls in love with a fellow contender named Miss Ladyship, and not only qualifies but goes on to win first prize at the competition. It turns out his father was not a fighter but a renowned show dog, and Wildfire is a chip off the old block. Wyndham subsequently warms to the fearless dog, admiring his courage, and learns to enjoy life again by accepting his own mortality.
Dorothy enters Wildfire in the Grand National Championship at Madison Square Garden, where the hero faces his destiny by competing against Regent Royal. Wildfire wins once again, but decides not to kill his father, having been touched by his Regent Royal’s gracious acceptance of defeat. A dog riot breaks out when Wildfire defends his father from heckling canines; thinking he has disgraced the Wyndhams, the hero flees the scene and subsequently becomes trapped by dogcatcher, one who coincidentally has Wildfire’s mother in his wagon. Wyndham arrives on the scene and buys Wildfire and his mother from the dogcatcher. Back at the estate, Regent Royal reunites with Wildfire’s mother and escaped pageant contestant Miss Ladyship goes on to give birth to a litter of Wildfire’s puppies.",drama dog life narrate wildfire voice vic morrow dog bull terrier better life affluent family adopt turn century mother roam street new york food shelter wildfire soon curious past seek answer knowledgeable old neighborhood dog inform father champion regent royal supposedly prize win fighter dog abandon mother pregnant wildfire resolve track father kill discover mother mysteriously vanish determined stray set quest honor wind dangerous bowery district successful pit fighter saloon wildfire flourish expertise ruthless hustler name patch mcgill jeff richard win streak come abrupt end master greedily match large dog mcgill blame wildfire loss prompt dog return waterfront fortune strike admirer animal caretaker jeremiah nolan edmund gwenn bring dog quarter massive countryside estate own self millionaire dog breeder mr wyndham play dean jagger bitter fail health wyndham initially oppose presence mongrel daughter dorothy sally fraser recognize dog beauty convince father let stay qualify ribbon local dog wildfire fall love fellow contender name miss ladyship qualify go win prize competition turn father fighter renowned dog wildfire chip old block wyndham subsequently warm fearless dog admire courage learn enjoy life accept mortality dorothy enter wildfire grand national championship madison square garden hero face destiny compete regent royal wildfire win decide kill father having touch regent royal gracious acceptance defeat dog riot break wildfire defend father heckle canine think disgrace wyndham hero flee scene subsequently trap dogcatcher coincidentally wildfire mother wagon wyndham arrive scene buy wildfire mother dogcatcher estate regent royal reunite wildfire mother escape pageant contestant miss ladyship go birth litter wildfire puppy
All the Right Moves,drama,"Stefen ""Stef"" Djordjevic (Tom Cruise) is a Serbian American high school defensive back who is gifted in both sports and academics. He is seeking a college football scholarship to escape the economically depressed small western Pennsylvania town of Ampipe and a dead-end job and life working at the mill like his father and brother Greg. He dreams of becoming an engineer right after he graduates from college. Ampipe is a company town whose economy is dominated by the town's main employer, American Pipe & Steel, a steel mill struggling through the downturn of the early 1980s recession. Stef gets through his days with the love of his girlfriend, Lisa Lietzke (Lea Thompson), and his strong bond with his teammates.
Most of the film takes place after the big football game against undefeated Walnut Heights High School. Ampipe appears headed to win the game, when a fumbled handoff in the closing seconds—as well as Stefen's pass interference penalty earlier in the game—leads to a Walnut Heights victory. Following the game, Coach Burt Nickerson (Craig T. Nelson) lambastes the fumbler in the locker room, telling him he ""quit"" the game. When Stefen retorts that the coach himself quit, the coach kicks him off the team.
In the aftermath, disgruntled Ampipe fans vandalize Coach Nickerson's house and yard. Stefen is present and is a reluctant participant, but is nonetheless seen by Nickerson as the vandals flee. From there, Stefen deals with personal battles, including dealing with the coach blackballing him among colleges because of his attitude and participation in the desecration of Nickerson's yard and house. Stefen gets in an argument with Lisa, and his best friend Brian (Chris Penn) declines college and plans to marry his girlfriend who is pregnant.
Stefen, frustrated by what Nickerson did, angrily confronts his former coach which ends in a shouting match out in the street. But Lisa decides to talk to Nickerson's wife to try and help. In the end, Nickerson realizes he was wrong for blackballing Stefan. He has accepted a coaching position at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and offers Stefen a full scholarship to play football there, which he accepts.",drama stefen stef djordjevic tom cruise serbian american high school defensive gift sport academic seek college football scholarship escape economically depressed small western pennsylvania town ampipe dead end job life work mill like father brother greg dream engineer right graduate college ampipe company town economy dominate town main employer american pipe steel steel mill struggle downturn early recession stef get day love girlfriend lisa lietzke lea thompson strong bond teammate film take place big football game undefeated walnut height high school ampipe appear head win game fumbled handoff closing second stefen pass interference penalty early game lead walnut height victory follow game coach burt nickerson craig nelson lambaste fumbler locker room tell quit game stefen retort coach quit coach kick team aftermath disgruntle ampipe fan vandalize coach nickerson house yard stefen present reluctant participant nonetheless see nickerson vandal flee stefen deal personal battle include deal coach blackball college attitude participation desecration nickerson yard house stefen get argument lisa good friend brian chris penn decline college plan marry girlfriend pregnant stefen frustrate nickerson angrily confront coach end shouting match street lisa decide talk nickerson wife try help end nickerson realize wrong blackball stefan accept coaching position cal poly san luis obispo offer stefen scholarship play football accept

King Richard and the Crusaders,adventure,"The film begins with King Richard the Lionheart (George Sanders) planning to attack the Saracens and defeat their leader, Sultan Saladin (Rex Harrison). Little does Richard know, though, the Castelaine knights who are supposed to follow him have other plans of their own. Giles of Conrad (Robert Douglas), a Castelaine supporter, sets up an assassination attempt of the King using a poisoned Saracen arrow in hopes that the arrow will kill the King, frame the enemy, and allow Giles of Conrad to promote one of his own to overtake the Saracens and be the victorious ruler of the land. The assassination attempt fails, and King Richard is discovered to still be alive, just before a new leader is about to be named. At this time, Sir Kenneth of Huntington (Laurence Harvey) enters King Richard’s camp, blaming Giles of Conrad and the Castelaine knights for the assassination attempt. Kenneth announces his loyalty to the King, but the King dismisses his thought that his own knights would assassinate him. The King then sends Kenneth to lead the Queen’s caravan as a scout to prove his loyalty to the kingdom.
On his scouting voyage, Kenneth crosses paths with a Saracen, and the two begin to duel. This does not last long though, as the two come to a chivalrous agreement to end the fighting and discuss their intentions of crossing through the desert. At this time, Kenneth learns that this Saracen is a physician named Emir Ilderim, sent by Saladin to heal King Richard. He says Saladin offers a truce until Richard is healed, because he would like to speak with him in person about the affairs of the nation and the war. Kenneth helps Ilderim get to Richard safely, and King Richard accepts the terms of Saladin’s truce and the help of his physician to return to full health.
Ilderim successfully heals King Richard, but not without stirring up trouble in the King’s camp first. After his return, Kenneth is given another chance to prove himself to King Richard by guarding the English flag that flies at the outskirts of the camp. At the same time, Ilderim is speaking with Lady Edith Plantagenet (Virginia Mayo), Richard’s relative and Kenneth’s love interest, and suggests to her that a marriage between a beautiful Christian woman (Edith) and a Muslim leader could bring peace to the land, without war. Kenneth sees this proposal and gets jealous, leaving his post at the flag to confront Ilderim. At this time, we see the Castelaine knights re-enter the story and knock down the English flag that Kenneth is supposed to be guarding. King Richard enters and sees Kenneth speaking with Edith and the flag on the ground. Richard becomes furious and sentences Kenneth to trial by combat. At the trial, Richard gains the upper hand, knocking Kenneth unconscious, but before he kills him, Ilderim asks the King to spare Kenneth’s life, stating that he will take him back to the Saracens and Kenneth will no longer be allowed in the English kingdom. The King, respecting the chivalry of Saladin to send Ilderim, agrees and banishes Kenneth from England.
When Kenneth awakes from the battle, he is in the Saracen camp being healed by Ilderim and living like royalty. Despite these gifts and Ilderim’s kindness to save his life, Kenneth can only think of Edith and how he is going to return to her. Ilderim then explains to Kenneth that he is banished, but that he needs his help. Ilderim reveals to Kenneth that he is actually Saladin, ruler of the Saracens, and that he has found who is trying to overthrow King Richard, the Castelaine knights. Kenneth returns to King Richard in disguise to warn him about the danger he is in.
The Castelaines overhear Kenneth warning Richard of their plan. They then steal away Edith and attempt to return to the Castelaine castle and defend themselves from there. Because of the mutual interests in Edith by Richard, Kenneth, and Saladin, the three unite to defeat the Castelaines. After a successful battle and chase across the country side, the Castelaines are defeated, Kenneth and Edith plan to marry, King Richard forgives Kenneth, and Saladin rides away safely back to his kingdom.",adventure film begin king richard lionheart george sanders plan attack saracen defeat leader sultan saladin rex harrison little richard know castelaine knight suppose follow plan gile conrad robert douglas castelaine supporter set assassination attempt king poisoned saracen arrow hope arrow kill king frame enemy allow gile conrad promote overtake saracens victorious ruler land assassination attempt fail king richard discover alive new leader name time sir kenneth huntington laurence harvey enter king richard camp blame gile conrad castelaine knight assassination attempt kenneth announce loyalty king king dismiss thought knight assassinate king send kenneth lead queen caravan scout prove loyalty kingdom scouting voyage kenneth crosse path saracen begin duel long come chivalrous agreement end fighting discuss intention cross desert time kenneth learn saracen physician name emir ilderim send saladin heal king richard say saladin offer truce richard heal like speak person affair nation war kenneth help ilderim richard safely king richard accept term saladin truce help physician return health ilderim successfully heal king richard stir trouble king camp return kenneth give chance prove king richard guard english flag fly outskirt camp time ilderim speak lady edith plantagenet virginia mayo richard relative kenneth love interest suggest marriage beautiful christian woman edith muslim leader bring peace land war kenneth see proposal get jealous leave post flag confront ilderim time castelaine knight enter story knock english flag kenneth suppose guard king richard enter see kenneth speak edith flag ground richard furious sentence kenneth trial combat trial richard gain upper hand knock kenneth unconscious kill ilderim ask king spare kenneth life state saracens kenneth long allow english kingdom king respect chivalry saladin send ilderim agree banishe kenneth england kenneth awake battle saracen camp heal ilderim live like royalty despite gift ilderim kindness save life kenneth think edith go return ilderim explain kenneth banish need help ilderim reveal kenneth actually saladin ruler saracens find try overthrow king richard castelaine knight kenneth return king richard disguise warn danger castelaine overhear kenneth warning richard plan steal away edith attempt return castelaine castle defend mutual interest edith richard kenneth saladin unite defeat castelaine successful battle chase country castelaine defeat kenneth edith plan marry king richard forgives kenneth saladin ride away safely kingdom

The Show,drama,"Cock Robin (John Gilbert) is a sideshow barker in Budapest.

As Jokanaan, Robin has his head seemingly chopped off and presented to the dancer on a platter, much to the delight of the audience.
Salome wants to get back together with Robin, but he has his sights set on Lena (Gertrude Short), the daughter of a well-off sheep merchant. He lets the smitten Lena buy him things. The Greek (Lionel Barrymore), Salome's current boyfriend, becomes angered when he learns of her feelings. The Greek and his henchman, the Ferret, also try to steal Lena's father's money, but fail to find it after they murder him.
That night, a heartbroken Lena tells Robin that her father has been killed. She trustingly shows him the substantial amount of money she had been holding for her father; when Robin ascertains that she has no brothers and that she has many more sheep, he becomes very interested. However, Salome eavesdrops, bursts in and warns Lena that Robin is only after her for her wealth. Lena flees, without her money. Robin is furious and can barely restrain himself from beating Salome.
When Lena shows up at the sideshow with a policeman, Salome has Robin hide in her attic. One day, an old blind man (Edward Connelly), another resident of the building, comes to Salome to have her read to him another letter from his son; Salome tells him that the man has been promoted to captain and received a decoration. She assures the old man that his son will return someday with his regiment. Later, however, she reveals to Robin that the son is actually in the prison across the street, scheduled to be hanged the next morning. That morning, the old man hears voices in Salome's room and assumes his son has finally come home.

Lisa dislikes the idea of dating a relatively impoverished young doctor, and is pregnant out of wedlock by another man. Although John offers to solve her problem by marrying her, she pressures him to illegally obtain pills for her in hopes of ending the pregnancy. He finally does so, and is caught and reported by Lew, ending their friendship and John's medical career.

Madolyn Bruckner (Haya Harareet) aspires to become a surgeon under abrasive Dr. Domenic Riccio (Savalas).

Riccio later finds out Madolyn has already been married and has a child, yet is still pursuing her medical career as a single working mother.
At the end of the year, Alec, Lew, and several other interns come under suspicion when a terminally ill, immobile patient who has been begging to die is found dead of a barbiturate overdose.

They decide to go to Vietnam, as they have heard that there is money to be made as smugglers due to the war.
Ben, Paul, and Frank get a load of contraband goods from a Hong Kong smuggler and agree to take them to a Vietnamese gangster named Leong. The three friends leave and reach Saigon by boat, only to have a Vietcong suicide bomber destroy all of their goods in an attempt on an officer of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. They are arrested as suspects in the bombing and beaten, until the real bomber is discovered and executed in front of them. They meet Luke, a hitman working for Leong, who dreams of escaping Vietnam with Sally, a nightclub singer Leong has kidnapped and forced into prostitution. The four men attempt to save her, a plan which goes wrong and culminates in a shootout in the nightclub. During the altercation Paul discovers a box of gold in Leong's office and steals it. They escape the nightclub, but Sally is shot in the back and injured.
The next morning, the five of them wait by the river for a boat that is supposed to pick them up. Ben and Frank are concerned with Sally and Paul guards the gold. They are attacked by gangsters and the ARVN as the boat arrives, and Sally dies just as they board it. Luke lets her body drift down the river. As they escape, the boat breaks down, and Paul becomes distressed over losing the gold. The three friends fight over Paul's preoccupation with the gold, and Ben and Frank tell him that the friendship is over. The boat is attacked by gangsters and sunk. Luke, Ben, and Frank escape, but Paul goes back for the gold, almost drowning before Ben and Frank save him and the gold.
Ben, Paul, and Frank are captured by the Vietcong and taken to a concentration camp. The Vietcong take the gold, and find intelligence documents in the box that Leong was going to sell to the North Vietnamese. The three friends are brutally interrogated, and Paul claims to work for the CIA to save the others. Frank is forced to kill other prisoners, which distresses him, but Ben asks to join in. When he is told to kill Frank he turns on their captors and they escape, aided by the arrival of a squad of Americans led by Luke. Paul escapes from the Vietcong as well and takes the gold into a field. Frank, who is wounded, follows him and begs for help. They hide from the Vietcong and Paul urges Frank to be quiet, but he continues to scream in pain and fear, and Paul finally shoots him in the back of the head to silence him. Luke rushes to Frank's side, finding him still alive, and loads him into a helicopter.
Ben chases Paul, who finds his way to a peaceful river village and steals a boat, massacring the villagers in the process. Ben witnesses this, and when he tries to save a child Paul shoots them both and escapes. Ben is saved by some monks, and eventually makes his way back to Saigon, where a badly disfigured Luke, who tells him that Frank is still alive, but that his head injury has changed him; he is now addicted to heroin and works as a contract killer. Luke takes Ben to see him, and after a brief altercation, Ben shoots Frank to put him out of his misery.
Ben travels back to Hong Kong and is reunited with Jane, who has given birth to a child. Meanwhile, Paul has become a successful businessman. Ben confronts him over his actions, showing him Frank's skull and blaming him for what happened to him. Paul is indifferent and kicks Ben out. Later, Ben attacks Paul on the street and they engage in a car chase. They find themselves on the pier where they played together as children. They crash their cars, and continue to fight.

Athena,musical,"Conservative lawyer Adam Calhorn Shaw (Edmund Purdom) hopes to be elected to office, like his father, and his father's father. He is engaged to a sophistocated society lady, Beth Hallson (Linda Christian).
Arriving at a nursery to complain about the peach trees he had previously purchased, Adam meets the energetic and eccentric Athena Mulvain (Jane Powell), the oldest of seven sisters in a family of anti-smoking, vegetarian, teetotallers who follow astrology and numerology.
Athena offers to give him advice on how to mulch the peach trees, however, Adam is uneasy, and leaves. Later, at a party, Athena arrives, mulches Adam's peach trees, kisses him, and announces her intention to marry him. She also decides, after a numerological calculation, that Adam's friend Johnny Nyle (Vic Damone) would be perfect for her sister, Minerva (Debbie Reynolds).
Athena returns to Adam's house the next morning, to the shock of Adam's fiancée. Adam promises to tell Athena that he has no romantic interest in her, but finds she has left. He asks his legal secretary Miss Seely to search for her but to no avail. Eventually Johnny returns and tells Adam that Athena's family owns a health food store, and that he can find her there.
That night when Adam goes to the house, he meets the meditating Grandma Salome, Minerva and Athena's 5 other beautiful, singing and dancing sisters: Niobe, Aphrodite, Calliope, Medea and Ceres. He also meets the bodybuilders that the girls' grandfather Louis Calhern) has been training for the Mr. Universe competition, Ed Perkins and Bill Nichols.
Despite the bizarre ways of the family, and although Adam initially tries to resist Athena, he eventually succumbs to her charms, and breaks up with Beth. Just when all is looking rosy, Grandma foresees difficult times ahead. Athena's sisters advise Athena to break up with Adam, however Athena chooses to push ahead with the relationship, knowing that ""love can change the stars"".
The sisters visit Adam's house while he is out and perform a makeover, removing rugs and screens and installing large urns and fresh flowers. Adam's influential family friend, Mr. Grenville, Adam's law firm partner, Mr. Griswalde, and Adam's campaign manager for election to the United States Congress, Mr. Tremaine, phone Adam's house and reach Athena on the phone. Curious, they visit Adam's house only to find Grandma there in place of the girls.
Adam invites Athena to a formal reception at Mr. Grenville's home. Athena at first charms the party with her pleasant nature and an off-the-cuff rendition of an aria from a Donizetti opera. However she loses her temper when Beth presents Athena with a buffet dinner where all of the vegetables are stuffed with meat.
More difficulties arise when Adam humiliates Ed Perkins and Grandpa on television at the ""Mr. Universe"" final. Grandpa had hoped that Ed would marry Athena to produce perfect children. Adam verbally attacks Grandpa over the hypocrisy of many of his beliefs. Ed threatens Adam by putting him in a hold that Adam gets out of by throwing Ed in a jiu jitsu throw with both events appearing on nationwide television. Adam is told by his minders that his political career is over because he embarrassed the belief system of Athena's people, alienating voters with those sympathies, whilst those opposed to their beliefs would associate Adam with holding their beliefs by merely being with them.

Maqbool,"mystery, drama","The film is based on William Shakespeare's Macbeth, with the Mumbai underworld as its backdrop. Maqbool (Irrfan Khan) is the right-hand man of Jahangir Khan (alias Abba Ji) (Pankaj Kapur), a powerful underworld don. Maqbool is grateful and feels a close connection and personal indebtedness to Abba Ji. Seeing their close relationship, but also sensing Maqbool's ambition, two corrupt policemen (Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah) predict that Maqbool will soon take over the reins of the Mumbai Underworld from Abba Ji.
Nimmi (Tabu) is Abba Ji's mistress, but she and Maqbool are secretly in love. Nimmi encourages Maqbool's ambitions and persuades him to kill Abba Ji to take over as Don. Maqbool is torn between his love for Nimmi and his loyalty to Abba Ji, but he begins to prepare the ground for becoming a Don, by ensuring that others in the line of succession cannot interfere. Finally, Maqbool murders Abba Ji in cold blood while he is in bed at night, with Nimmi next to him. Maqbool gets away with the murder and takes over as Don, just as planned; but both he and Nimmi are haunted by guilt, seeing Abba Ji's ghost and unable to wash the blood from their hands. There is also suspicion, within the gang, of Maqbool's role in the death of Abba Ji, and eventually the lovers meet a tragic end.

Room Service,comedy,"Gordon Miller (Groucho Marx), a flat-broke theatrical producer, whose staff includes Harry Binelli (Chico) and Faker Englund (Harpo), is told by brother-in-law Joseph Gribble (Cliff Dunstan), manager of the White Way Hotel, that he and his cast of twenty-two actors, who have run up an enormous bill of $1,200, have to leave the hotel immediately or face the wrath of supervising director Gregory Wagner (Donald MacBride). Miller has assembled the cast and crew of his play, Hail and Farewell, in the hotel ballroom. Miller is planning on skipping out on the hotel without paying the bill when he receives word that one of his actresses, Christine Marlowe (Lucille Ball), has arranged for a backer. Miller must keep his room and hide the cast and crew until the meeting with the backer can take place.
At the same time, Wagner discovers the debt. Assured by Gribble that Miller had skipped, Wagner is surprised to find Miller still in his room, now joined by the play's author, Leo Davis (Frank Albertson), who has arrived in town and checked into Miller's room.
When Wagner threatens to evict Miller before the backer can arrive, Miller and Binelli convince Davis to pretend to be sick. To obtain food, Miller promises waiter Sasha Smirnoff (Alexander Asro) a part in the play. When Davis leaves to meet with girlfriend Hilda Manney (Ann Miller), Englund takes over as the sick patient examined by a doctor brought in by Mr. Wagner. Wagner leaves to confront the crowd in the ballroom, while the doctor examines the patient. To delay the doctor giving his report to Wagner, Binelli and Miller tie him up, gag him, and lock him in the bathroom. The agent for Mr. Fisk arrives to sign over the cheque, the doctor breaks free in the bathroom, and the agent is hit on the head accidentally as Englund chases a flying turkey around with a baseball bat. The agent just wants to escape the madness, but reluctantly signs over the cheque, and leaves.
Davis returns and says he heard the agent saying he'll cancel the cheque, and just signed it to get out of the room. Wagner is fooled into believing all is okay, and upgrades the boys to a fancier room. Later, as the play is about to open, the cheque from Fisk bounces, Miller, Binelli, and Englund manipulate Wagner into believing he's driven the play's author to take poison. They pretend to give Davis large quantities of Ipecac (which is actually drunk by Englund), and he eventually pretends to die. Wagner is bluffed into believing it's all his fault and helps take the ""body"" down to the alley. As Miller and Wagner prop Englund on a crate, a passing policeman asks what's going on. Miller bluffs their way out of the situation, so he and Wagner make an escape, leaving Englund ""asleep"". They go to watch the end of the play, which is a scene where the miners are bringing a body from out of the mine. The body on the stretcher is Englund's.

Gunhed,"science fiction, action","In the early 2030s, a new material called Texmexium (more powerful than nuclear energy) enabled the world to be controlled by a new generation of super computers. Due to fear of misusing Texmexium, it was guarded within hyper-nuclear facilities that powered every major city. Concurrently occurring was the world's depletion in raw materials to create new all-powerful computers; conductive plastics and computer chips have out-valued gold and gave rise to tech scavengers that seek their fortunes through acquiring and selling computer parts despite the extreme dangers.
During the year 2005, the Cybortech Company built one of the most advanced robotics development facilities upon a small Asian island simply called 8JO. Controlled by a highly advanced A.I.system, Kyron-5, the A.I. autonomously ran the island for 20 years until it come to realize humanity wasn't needed and began to use their own technologies to rebel against humanity; the great robot war began. To quell Kyron-5's insurrection, the allied powers dispatched a GUNHED battalion in attempt to stop Kyron-5, however, it was being protected by a powerful guardian, Aerobot. The battalion was defeated and all of its remains were thrown in a scrap yard. The conflict never had a clear victor, but the world allies chose to leave 8JO alone, it would be 13 years later for anyone to discover Kyron-5's survival and true intentions.
The year is now 2038, the scavenger crew of the Mary Ann has infiltrated 8JO and begins their mission to scavenge computer chips. Captain Bansho, Brooklyn, Babe, Barabbas, and Bombbay infiltrated the lower decks while Boomerang and Boxer monitored things near the Mary Ann. Not long, Boxer and Boomerang gets killed by the automated defenses on the landing pad. As the infiltration team heads deeper into Kyron-5, Bansho and Barabbas are killed inside the elevator as the defenses attacked them. Brooklyn, Babe, and Bombbay managed to survive the assault and bumped into an injured Texas Air Ranger, Sgt Nim.
Nim was on a mission with her partner to hunt down a Bio-Droid that stole a vial of Texmexium for Kyron-5, but her helicopter was destroyed and her partner killed in action. Nim herself was injured and Brooklyn helped her. The four traveled together in safety, but Bombbay is shortly killed by the droid Nim was hunting. The surviving trio made it to Kyron-5's core room, where they found a vial of Texmexium; the Bio-Droid wanted it back. While fighting for the Texmexium, Babe fell into a vat of chemicals along with the droid. Brooklyn and Nim considers her dead, but she actually somehow merged with the droid as a single conflicting entity. As the only two survivors, Brooklyn wants to keep the Texmexium because it cost him his comrades, but Nim wanted it to complete her mission; both objectives would have to put on hold as they encountered Aerobot.
The two survived their encounter with Aerobot by escaping into a deep chute, to be discovered by the sole surviving children of the original human custodians of Kyron-5, Seven (younger brother) and Eleven (mute older sister). Together, they formulated a plan to get back on the landing pad of Kyron-5 and escape with the Mary Ann, but their situation is hampered by both Kyron-5 and the Bio-Droid after them. However, it was by chance, at the robot graveyard, that Brooklyn found the remains of a GUNHED (Gun UNit of Heavy Eliminate Device).
Using his technical skills, Brooklyn brought GUNHED back online and it was through GUNHED that the crew learned that Kyron-5 only stopped conflicting with humanity 13 years ago to wait for them to complete developing Texmexium for its plans for global domination. Despite learning the threat it could pose against humanity, Nim was focused only on her mission and leaving the facility. Nim and Eleven left together for the Kyron-5 core room, while Seven stayed with Brooklyn to complete repairs on GUNHED and used it to escape Kyron-5. Brooklyn has personal anxieties about piloting, but he had to overcome it to survive. It was while during her leave that the droid found her and retaken the Texmexium to aid Kyron-5's plan.
With the aid of GUNHED, Brooklyn was able to clear through the various deadly obstacles and defenses of Kyron-5. However, Aerobot remains at large. Brooklyn fought with GUNHED to take down Aerobot, but the unit defeated GUNHED. Brooklyn escaped out of the tank and rigged a part of its functional gun to manually shoot Aerobot. Brooklyn managed to take the heavy gun and finally destroy Aerobot once and for all. In between, Nim realized Eleven was part of Kyron-5's plan as it actually inserted a special activation code within her (the source of her muteness); she would uncontrollably help Kyron-5 execute its plans, however, Nim intervened and prevented her from launching the code. The Bio-Droid returned to stop everyone, but Babe realized she couldn't escape being trapped inside and decided to detonate a grenade within the droid's body to help the four escape; both the droid and Babe were destroyed.
Kyron-5's plans have failed and now it activates the self-destruction sequence to detonate 8JO.

3 Idiots,comedy,"Onboard a departing Air India flight Farhan Qureshi suddenly receives a call from Chatur Ramalingam claiming that he has found Rancho. He then causes an emergency landing by feigning a heart attack. Farhan fetches Raju Rastogi and they meet Chatur at a water tank in their old college campus; Chatur revealing that Rancho is in Shimla.
As they drive their way to Shimla, a flashback shows Farhan and Raju beginning their college year in the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. They are joined Ranchoddas ""Rancho"" Chanchad. While Farhan takes engineering over photography to please his father, Raju takes the course to lift his family from poverty. Rancho, on the other hand, believes in hands on learning and tends to give unorthodox answers in class, coming into conflict with professors, in particular with the institution's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe or ""Virus"", whose traditional and strict philosophies on education contrast sharply with Rancho's carefree love of learning. Meanwhile, Chatur, nicknamed “Silencer"", is an arrogant Ugandan-born Tamil student with little knowledge of Hindi, who is obsessed with topping the exams. During a Teachers' Day event, Chatur is humiliated when he delivers a Hindi speech modified by Rancho, and bets Rancho that ten years later, they would see who is more successful. Ranch later befriends Virus' daughter Pia, who is a residency student at the city's hospital.
One night during their senior year, the three friends drunkenly break into Virus' house. As the three friends escape, Virus recognizes Raju, and threatens to expel him unless he writes a letter implicating Rancho in the break-in. Unwilling to betray Rancho who once saved his father's life, Raju unsuccessfully attempts suicide. With intensive care and support from his friends, Raju recovers in time for a corporate job interview. Meanwhile, Rancho and Pia post Farhan's letter to his favorite photographer, Andre Istvan, who offers him a position as assistant. After advice from Rancho, he communicates his dream to his father, who gives his blessing.
Infuriated by Rancho's influence, Virus sets a difficult final exam to fail Raju. Pia tries to help the trio by revealing to them the location of the exam paper, but Virus finds out and expels them. Pia confronts Virus about her brother who committed suicide because he couldn't meet Virus' expectation of clearing the engineering exam. That same night Virus' pregnant elder daughter Mona goes into labor during a heavy storm, and Rancho and the other students use their engineering knowledge to deliver the baby with the help of Pia over video call. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student, allowing the three to graduate. Unexpectedly, Rancho disappears shortly after the convocation.
Returning to the present, Farhan is a successful wildlife photographer, Raju is married is settled in a comfortable lifestyle with a corporate job and wife, and Chatur is vice president of a reputed corporation in the United States. None of them have heard from Rancho since graduation. Arriving at Shimla, they meet a man who turns out to be the real Ranchoddas Chanchad. From him, they learn that the Rancho they knew was actually ""Chhote"", an orphaned servant to the Chanchad family. Ranchoddas' father arranged for Chhote to attend ICE in his son's name, so that his son could take credit for the degree. Ranchoddas provides Chhote's address in Ladakh, where he is a school teacher. On the way, they pass Manali and rescue Pia from marrying her materialistic boyfriend Suhas, so that she can marry Rancho.
Upon arrival in Ladakh, the four find the village school, witnessing young students' inventions that resemble Rancho's own college projects. Raju, Farhan, and Pia then happily reunite with Rancho but Chatur insults Rancho, and asks him to sign a statement that he is the less successful one. Without comment, Rancho does so. As Chatur walks away in triumph, Rancho reveals himself to be Phunsukh Wangdu, a world-renowned inventor with over 400 patents, with whom Chatur seeks a contract. A horrified Chatur accepts his defeat and begs him to sign the contract while Pia and the three friends run away laughing.",comedy onboard depart air india flight farhan qureshi suddenly receive chatur ramalingam claim find rancho cause emergency landing feign heart attack farhan fetch raju rastogi meet chatur water tank old college campus chatur reveal rancho shimla drive way shimla flashback show farhan raju begin college year prestigious imperial college engineering ice delhi join ranchoddas rancho chanchad farhan take engineering photography father raju take course lift family poverty rancho hand believe hand learn tend unorthodox answer class come conflict professor particular institution director dr viru sahastrabuddhe virus traditional strict philosophy education contrast sharply rancho carefree love learn chatur nickname silencer arrogant ugandan bear tamil student little knowledge hindi obsess top exam teacher day event chatur humiliate deliver hindi speech modify rancho bet rancho year later successful ranch later befriend virus daughter pia residency student city hospital night senior year friend drunkenly break virus house friend escape virus recognize raju threaten expel write letter implicate rancho break unwilling betray rancho save father life raju unsuccessfully attempt suicide intensive care support friend raju recover time corporate job interview rancho pia post farhan letter favorite photographer andre istvan offer position assistant advice rancho communicate dream father give blessing infuriate rancho influence virus set difficult final exam fail raju pia try help trio reveal location exam paper virus find expel pia confront virus brother commit suicide meet virus expectation clear engineering exam night virus pregnant eld daughter mona go labor heavy storm rancho student use engineering knowledge deliver baby help pia video grateful virus finally acknowledge rancho extraordinary student allow graduate unexpectedly rancho disappear shortly convocation return present farhan successful wildlife photographer raju married settle comfortable lifestyle corporate job wife chatur vice president reputed corporation united states hear rancho graduation arrive shimla meet man turn real ranchoddas chanchad learn rancho know actually chhote orphan servant chanchad family ranchoddas father arrange chhote attend ice son son credit degree ranchoddas provide chhote address ladakh school teacher way pass manali rescue pia marry materialistic boyfriend suha marry rancho arrival ladakh find village school witness young student invention resemble rancho college project raju farhan pia happily reunite rancho chatur insult rancho ask sign statement successful comment rancho chatur walk away triumph rancho reveal phunsukh wangdu world renowne inventor patent chatur seek contract horrified chatur accept defeat beg sign contract pia friend run away laughing

An extremely important client, Simon Nurdlinger (Edward G. Robinson), is considering taking his business elsewhere when he believes there are no ""family men"" working at Sam's company. Sam's boss, Mr. Burke (Edward Andrews), introduces the client to Sam. The client is delighted by Sam and agrees to do business with him and the company. Sam feels his career is now on the way up and he goes home to celebrate with his wife. There, he meets his wife's longtime friend and their new next-door neighbor, Janet (Romy Schneider), and they all have dinner together to celebrate his promotion and Janet's new home. Sam gets drunk and tumbles down the grand carpeted staircase of the Fairmont Hotel, knocking down a waiter carrying trays of meals.
Janet, a beautiful woman, is recently divorced from her husband Howard (Michael Connors) and is happier than ever. She has also come into a large inheritance from her grandfather, which carries the stipulation that she must still be married to Howard in order to receive the inheritance.

Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress Pt.2,"horror, post-apocalyptic, steampunk, spy, action","A mysterious virus appears during the industrial revolution that transforms infected humans into Kabane (カバネ, ""corpses"") and rapidly spreads. Kabane are aggressive, undead creatures that cannot be defeated unless the glowing heart, which is protected by a layer of lead, is pierced, or an important body part is completely severed (such as the head). Unfortunately, most melee weapons and the steam-pressure guns used by the bushi (武士, ""soldiers"") are not very effective against them.
On the island country Hinomoto (日ノ本), people have built fortress-like ""stations"" to shelter themselves from these creatures. People access the stations and transport wares between them with the help of fortified steam locomotives (駿城, hayajirō). One day, a hayajirō hijacked by the Kabane crashes into Aragane Station and they overrun the city. A young engineer called Ikoma uses the opportunity to test with success his anti-Kabane weapon, the ""piercing gun"" (ツラヌキ筒, tsuranuki zutsu), but is infected in the process, although he manages to resist the virus and become a Kabaneri (カバネリ), a human-Kabane hybrid.

"Bruce Lee, My Brother",biopic / drama,"Bruce Lee, My Brother is a dramatic biopic of the eponymous martial arts legend as told by his younger brother, Robert Lee. Based directly from the book ""Memories of Lee Siu-loong"", which is authored by Lee's siblings (Phoebe, Robert, Agnes and Peter),[3][4] it revolves around Bruce Lee's life as a rebellious adolescent in Hong Kong before he sets off for the USA and conquers the world at the age of 18 with only US$102 in his pocket.
As a young man, Bruce grew up in an affluent family. Entering the film industry at an early age, he gained fame as a child actor. Outside the home and studio, he was rebellious; he spent time engaging in street fights, dancing with lady friends, and hanging with his buddies, Kong and Unicorn, the latter a fellow child actor who would later appear in Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon. Invincible as he is as a street fighter, Bruce's romantic escapades are not as smooth and successful. He is head-over-heels in love with Pearl, only to realize his mate Kong shares the same passion. At a cha-cha dancing tournament, Kong tells Bruce his intentions of leaving Pearl so Bruce himself can have her, damaging their friendship. Bruce is unable to come to terms with Kong.
Against his father's wishes, Bruce studies the Wing Chun martial arts style instead of Tai-chi and tastes his first public triumph at a tournament with his kung fu skills against a boxer, whom immediately seeks a rematch. Tasting victory again, Bruce learns from his opponent that Kong has become a drug addict and infiltrates the drug lord's den together with Unicorn to rescue Kong, but the drug dealers confront them. Their actions lead to a long chase; although Bruce and his friends survive, Kong would later die trying to save his friends. Bruce himself becomes the target of both the Triads and corrupted cops who want him in jail. To save his life, Bruce's father has no choice but to send him off to San Francisco, California.",biopic drama bruce lee brother dramatic biopic eponymous martial art legend tell young brother robert lee base directly book memory lee siu loong author lee sibling phoebe robert agne revolve bruce lee life rebellious adolescent hong kong set usa conquer world age pocket young man bruce grow affluent family enter film industry early age gain fame child actor outside home studio rebellious spend time engage street fight dance lady friend hang buddy kong unicorn fellow child actor later appear fist fury way dragon invincible street fighter bruce romantic escapade smooth successful head heel love pearl realize mate kong share passion cha cha dancing tournament kong tell bruce intention leave pearl bruce damage friendship bruce unable come term kong father wish bruce study wing chun martial art style instead tai chi taste public triumph tournament kung fu skill boxer immediately seek rematch taste victory bruce learn opponent kong drug addict infiltrate drug lord den unicorn rescue kong drug dealer confront action lead long chase bruce friend survive kong later die try save friend bruce target triad corrupt cop want jail save life bruce father choice send san francisco california
Tales of Manhattan,"drama, comedy; 6 separate stories","The tailcoat is custom made for renowned stage actor Paul Orman (Charles Boyer), who seeks to rekindle a romance with former flame Ethel (Rita Hayworth), who is receptive. However, she is now married, and her husband John (Thomas Mitchell) finds them together. John offers to show Paul his weapon collection, in particular his favorite hunting rifle. He deliberately loads it. Paul makes no move to escape and is shot by the jealous husband. After Paul dies, John claims to his wife, the sole witness, that it was an accident. Ethel finally realizes she loves John and tells him so; she agrees to support his story. Paul comes back to life, surprising the couple and telling them that John missed completely. Paul then leaves the couple, but later collapses in his limousine. He instructs his valet Luther (Eugene Pallette) to take him to the hospital.
Later Luther offers the topcoat, complete with a bullet hole, as collateral for a $10 loan from his friend Edgar (Roland Young). Edgar is the butler of Harry Wilson (Cesar Romero), who is about to marry Diane (Ginger Rogers). However, Diane's friend Ellen (Gail Patrick), who is divorcing her husband for infidelity, dares her to examine the contents of Harry's topcoat. She finds a love letter from someone called ""Squirrel"" to her ""passionate lion"". Harry overhears and persuades his best man George (Henry Fonda) to pretend that he took Harry's topcoat by mistake after a party last night and that the letter is actually his. George, who has feelings for Diane himself, reluctantly agrees. Diane is completely fooled ... and begins to see George (whom she thought of as ""dim"") in an entirely different, much more romantic light. Diane learns the truth when Squirrel shows up. She dumps Harry and leaves with George.
Afterward, Luther and Edgar pawn the topcoat for $10. It eventually ends up with Charles Smith (Charles Laughton), an unknown classical music composer. A friend arranges a meeting with famed conductor Arturo Bellini (Victor Francen), who is impressed with his composition. He is offered the opportunity to conduct the premiere of his work at Carnegie Hall. At the last minute, he is informed he must be properly attired. Elsa hurriedly buys the topcoat for him, but it is a very tight fit. When he conducts, it rips at both shoulders and the audience erupts with laughter. Charles is brought to tears. However, Bellini stands up in his concert box, pointedly removes his own tailcoat and asks him to continue; one by one, the ""gentlemen"" in the audience remove their own tailcoats. After the triumphant performance, Charles donates the topcoat to charity.
Joe (James Gleason), who runs a mission for the poor, delivers a letter to alcoholic panhandler Larry Browne (Edward G. Robinson). It is an invitation to his 25th anniversary college reunion, held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Joe convinces Larry to attend, hoping it will help him rebuild his life. Larry manages to convince his former classmates that he is successful, even getting a job offer, but one of them, Williams (George Sanders), knows that Larry was a shady lawyer in Chicago who was disbarred. When one man cannot find his wallet, the group hold a mock trial, with Larry as the defendant and Williams as the prosecutor. In the end, Larry ultimately tells everything and leaves. The next morning, however, three of his classmates come to the mission to let him know the job is still his.
The topcoat ends up in a second-hand shop, where it is stolen by a thief (J. Carrol Naish). He wears it to get into an upscale illegal gambling parlor to rob the patrons. In his escape by plane, the jacket catches on fire and the panicked thief throws it out, with $43,000 of loot in the pockets. It lands by Luke (Paul Robeson) and Esther (Ethel Waters), a poor black couple. They take it to their minister (Eddie Anderson), and they decide to give to their congregation to buy whatever they have prayed for. An old farmer (George Reed) tells Luke that the only thing he prayed for is a scarecrow, so Luke gives him the now ragged jacket to make one.",drama comedy separate story tailcoat custom renowned stage actor paul orman charles boyer seek rekindle romance flame ethel rita hayworth receptive marry husband john thomas mitchell find john offer paul weapon collection particular favorite hunting rifle deliberately load paul make escape shoot jealous husband paul die john claim wife sole witness accident ethel finally realize love john tell agree support story paul come life surprise couple tell john miss completely paul leave couple later collapse limousine instruct valet luther eugene pallette hospital later luther offer topcoat complete bullet hole collateral loan friend edgar roland young edgar butler harry wilson cesar romero marry diane ginger roger diane friend ellen gail patrick divorce husband infidelity dare examine content harry topcoat find love letter call squirrel passionate lion harry overhears persuade good man george henry fonda pretend take harry topcoat mistake party night letter actually george feeling diane reluctantly agree diane completely fool begin george think dim entirely different romantic light diane learn truth squirrel show dump harry leave george afterward luther edgar pawn topcoat eventually end charles smith charles laughton unknown classical music composer friend arrange meeting famed conductor arturo bellini victor francen impressed composition offer opportunity conduct premiere work carnegie hall minute inform properly attire elsa hurriedly buy topcoat tight fit conduct rip shoulder audience erupt laughter charles bring tear bellini stand concert box pointedly remove tailcoat ask continue gentleman audience remove tailcoat triumphant performance charles donate topcoat charity joe james gleason run mission poor deliver letter alcoholic panhandler larry browne edward robinson invitation anniversary college reunion hold waldorf astoria hotel joe convince larry attend hope help rebuild life larry manage convince classmate successful get job offer williams george sanders know larry shady lawyer chicago disbar man find wallet group hold mock trial larry defendant williams prosecutor end larry ultimately tell leave morning classmate come mission let know job topcoat end second hand shop steal thief carrol naish wear upscale illegal gambling parlor rob patron escape plane jacket catch fire panicked thief throw loot pocket land luke paul robeson esther ethel water poor black couple minister eddie anderson decide congregation buy pray old farmer george reed tell luke thing pray scarecrow luke give ragged jacket

His wife, Jenny (Lolita Davidovich), becomes concerned that Carter is obsessively studying their daughter, Amy; he regards her like a scientist tracking the development of his creation. But Carter himself suffers from multiple personality disorder consisting of Cain, a street hustler, Josh, a shy 7-year-old boy, and Margo, a middle-aged nanny. Carter and Cain are killing young mothers to procure their children for his experiments.
Jenny is having an affair with Jack Dante (Steven Bauer), the widower of a former patient. She had a relationship with him years ago, but he left her. Now she plans to leave Carter and elope with him. When Carter accidentally discovers their tryst, he descends completely into his madness and begins leaving subtle clues for the police that Jack is the real killer. Next, he attempts to kill Jenny by submerging her car in a lake. She escapes and confronts Carter at home. Unable to find Amy, Jenny demands Carter tell her where she is. Carter replies that she is with his father, whom Jenny knows has been dead for years.
The police contact Dr. Lynn Waldheim (Frances Sternhagen) who co-wrote a book with Nix Sr. called Raising Cain, about a boy with multiple personality disorder. Nix Sr. had extensive detailed knowledge of Cain's tortured childhood, including taped recordings of their sessions. However, Waldheim was never allowed to meet Cain. She pieced the situation together: Nix Sr. dispassionately put his own son through years of severe child abuse to gain firsthand accounts of his traumatic psychological development and study the emerging personalities. Horrified, Waldheim quit the project. After making the connection, Carter is apprehended for attempted murder. Waldheim is sent in alone to interrogate him.
During interrogation, Margo and Josh act and speak for Carter. Josh recites a rhyme and vanishes, and Margo assumes control. She stonewalls Waldheim from any further questioning. Eventually, Carter and Cain break from their confines. They pounce upon Dr. Waldheim, knocking her unconscious and leaving the building disguised as her. The police soon find Waldheim begging them to arrest Carter before any children are harmed.
Nix Sr. (Lithgow) is in fact alive, having faked his own death to elude prosecution for attempting to buy babies. He has established a new identity and a clandestine research facility in Norway. He has been using Carter and his multiples to procure the children so he will have an adequate control group to study the development of MPD. Jenny follows who she thinks is Waldheim to a motel, but it is actually Carter/Cain. She follows Carter/Cain, who is now Margo, into an elevator. When it opens, she sees Nix Sr. with her daughter Amy. While Jenny begs for Nix Sr. to give back her daughter, Carter, Cain and Margo stabs ""their"" father from behind. Jack arrives with the police, and Carter and his personalities disappear.
The movie ends with Jenny and Amy in a park. Amy runs off into the woods calling ""Daddy, Daddy"". Jenny follows her and finds Amy, who says her father has gone away. When Jenny bends down to pick Amy up, Carter appears behind her in a wig and a dress; Margo is now in control.

Broken Lance,western,"Matthew Devereaux (Spencer Tracy) is a ranch owner who has built an enormous ranch and mining empire. He raised his sons to carry on his fierce, hard-working Irish settlement spirit, that helped make him a success. However, as a consequence, he's never shown his three older sons by his late first wife, Ben, Mike, and Denny (played respectively by Richard Widmark, Hugh O'Brian, and Earl Holliman), his affection as a father. He treats these grown men (in their 30s to their 40s) little better than hired help.
Even though they are managing the day-to-day operations of the ranch and other enterprises full time, Matt Devereaux still retains complete authority, right down to the smallest decisions, which angers his eldest son. So, the three elder sons are united against him, for reasons that have nothing to do with either the ranch, or its management.
Joe (Robert Wagner) is Matt's son by his second wife, a Native American, ""Señora"" (Katy Jurado). Because of Joe's mixed ethnicity, he is treated prejudicially by his three half-brothers—all Caucasian sons of Matt's first wife. The town's people call her Señora out of respect for Matt, but not out of respect for her. Matt Devereaux's power and prestige keeps the discrimination by the townspeople towards Joe to a minimum, so long as Joe, an emerging young adult, is principally interested in riding the range alone, and spending time at his mother's native American reservation and with her people.
Joe loves his father and would do anything for him. Because of his wife's insistence that he change his attitude towards their son, Matt Devereaux comes to appreciate his youngest son. This allows Matt to converse with the son, who shows no interest in owning and running the ranch empire. The older brothers interpret this as a rejection by their father, and an attempt to live the lie that he has only one son and not four. Resentment ensues.
The two middle sons rustle cattle and get two Mexicans killed, then get caught by two Indian workers whom they sacked the year before and shot by Matt. After 40 head of cattle die, Matt determines that a copper mine is polluting a stream where he waters his cattle. He becomes furious and leads a raid on the mine offices and director. The mine is on Matt's land, and he has leased out the mineral rights. The law issues a warrant to arrest whoever was responsible for the attack. To spare his father the agony and humiliation of a stay behind bars, Joe claims responsibility and is sentenced to three years in prison.
Ben and his other brothers rebel against their father in Joe´s absence with such fierceness that the old man suffers a fatal stroke. Joe is permitted to leave prison long enough to attend his father's funeral, during which he formally severs his ties with his brothers and proclaims a blood feud.[4]
Released from prison several years later, Joe returns to the ranch. The señora, his mother, persuades him to forget revenge and leave the country. Joe decides to take her advice, but Ben, fearing his revenge because he killed his father in the end, crosses his path and tries to kill him. The two half-brothers fight until Two Moons, the ranch foreman, shoots Ben dead to save Joe´s life. Time passes, and Joe and his new wife Barbara (Jean Peters) visit Matt's grave. There, Joe sees the down-turned lance, the Indian symbol for a blood feud, and breaks it in half, thus ending the feud.[5]",western matthew devereaux spencer tracy ranch owner build enormous ranch mining empire raise son carry fierce hard work irish settlement spirit help success consequence show old son late wife ben mike denny play respectively richard widmark hugh earl holliman affection father treat grow man little well hire help manage day day operation ranch enterprise time matt devereaux retain complete authority right small decision anger eld son elder son unite reason ranch management joe robert wagner matt son second wife native american señora katy jurado joe mixed ethnicity treat prejudicially half brother caucasian son matt wife town people señora respect matt respect matt devereaux power prestige keep discrimination townspeople joe minimum long joe emerge young adult principally interested ride range spend time mother native american reservation people joe love father wife insistence change attitude son matt devereaux come appreciate young son allow matt converse son show interest own run ranch empire old brother interpret rejection father attempt live lie son resentment ensue middle son rustle cattle mexican kill catch indian worker sack year shoot matt head cattle die matt determine copper pollute stream water cattle furious lead raid office director matt land lease mineral right law issue warrant arrest responsible attack spare father agony humiliation stay bar joe claim responsibility sentence year prison ben brother rebel father absence fierceness old man suffer fatal stroke joe permit leave prison long attend father funeral formally sever tie brother proclaim blood release prison year later joe return ranch señora mother persuade forget revenge leave country joe decide advice ben fear revenge kill father end cross path try kill half brother fight moon ranch foreman shoots ben dead save life time pass joe new wife barbara jean peters visit matt grave joe see turn lance indian symbol blood feud break half end

The Hellstrom Chronicle,mockumentary,"A fictitious scientist called Dr. Nils Hellstrom (played by Lawrence Pressman) guides viewers throughout the film. He claims, on the basis of scientific-sounding theories, that insects will ultimately win the fight for survival on planet Earth because of their adaptability and ability to reproduce rapidly, and that the human race will lose this fight largely because of excessive individualism. The film combines short clips from horror and science fiction movies with extraordinary camera sequences of butterflies, locusts, wasps, termites, ants, mayflies, other insects rarely seen before on film and insectivorous plants/insects.
Technical advisers Roy Snelling and Charles Hogue, were entomologists at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History.[2]",mockumentary fictitious scientist call dr nils hellstrom play lawrence pressman guide viewer film claim basis scientific sound theory insect ultimately win fight survival planet earth adaptability ability reproduce rapidly human race lose fight largely excessive individualism film combine short clip horror science fiction movie extraordinary camera sequence butterfly locust wasp termite ant mayfly insect rarely see film insectivorous plant insect technical adviser roy snelling charles hogue entomologist los angeles county museum natural

Their children have grown and Juliette is looking forward to spending more time with Mark. Delayed, Mark asks his friend—a handsome Egyptian named Tareq—to watch over Juliette. Mark is continually delayed in Gaza, during which time Juliette makes friends with Cairo locals, North American and European ex-pats like Kathryn, explores the city and the surrounding area, and finds herself falling in love with the city during her ""Cairo Time"".
Tareq is a regular (but not constant) companion during Juliette's extended time waiting for Mark, leading to a very close relationship between the two.

After travelling to Alexandria with him to attend the wedding of the daughter (Hanan) of a girlfriend from his university days (Yasmeen), she admits that she will miss him when she returns to Canada.

Kinnikuman the Movie: Stolen Championship Belt,anime for children,"After winning the 21st Choujin Olympics, Kinnikuman plans to build his own theme park. As his friends and celebrities arrive, the sky grows dark and with a flash of lightning Kinnikuman's championship belt is gone. He then sees that it has been taken by Octopus Dragon III, who challenges him to take it back. Kinnikuman tries but fails and Mari is kidnapped. Octopus Dragon gives Kinnikuman a time limit to save her before she is fed to the monster Gigasaurus and then returns to his home world of Planet Metro (メトロ星,, Metoro-sei). Despite his injuries, Kinnikuman is determined to go and reclaim his belt and Mari. Luckily, Terryman, Ramenman, Robin Mask, Warsman, Brocken Jr., and Rikishiman arrive to lend him a hand.
Upon arrival on Planet Metro, they are spotted by two minions of Octopus Dragon (series creators Yudetamago in a cameo). They report back to Octopus Dragon, who sends his Kyou'aku Choujin (凶悪超人,, Villainous Supermen) off to stop the Idol Choujins from advancing. They first come across Harigorasu, who is guarding a log bridge. Rikishiman volunteers to fight him and eventually causes them both to fall over into the valley below. Although Rikishiman manages to grab hold of the wall of the valley, he tells Kinnikuman and the others to go on without him as it would take too much time to save him. When Kinnikuman refuses, he lets go of the wall and falls into the valley.
They next meet the ninjutsu Choujin Ukon and his minions. After a comical scene where Kinnikuman mishears Ukon's name as unko (うんこ,, poop), Ramenman and Brocken Jr. volunteer to take them on while the others continue on the journey. As they continue, Robin Mask and Warsman volunteer to take on AmeRug Boss and his minons so Kinnikuman and Terryman can continue. However, Warsman meets up with them again and tells of how Robin threw himself and several of the enemies into an erupting volcano. Warsman then ends up taking on another group of enemies by himself, urging Kinnikuman and Terryman to continue.
Kinnikuman and Terryman finally find Mari but are immediately challenged by Octopus Dragon to a tag match against himself and Mouko-seijin. Broadcast all over the universe, the fight takes place in a ring with electric ropes. The ropes are powered by a machine that Octopus Dragon's minion Gammalar turns off whenever his boss needs to use the ropes. After a fierce struggle, Terryman defeats Mouko-seijin with his trademark Calf Branding but is shot by Gammalar before he can help Kinnikuman. Kinnikuman remembers the sacrifices his friends have made for him and evokes the Kajiba no Kuso Djikara. He then defeats Octopus Dragon with the Fuu Rin Ka Zan followed by the Kinniku Buster.
Gammalar then tries to shoot Mari down into Gigasaurus' mouth, but Kinnikuman knock him away and catches Mari. With his last breath, Octopus Dragon releases Gigasaurus from his prison and the monster immediately goes after Kinnikuman and Mari. Kinnikuman is almost eaten by Gigasaurus but is saved by Ramenman and Rikishiman. He then manages to lure the beast into falling over the side of a cliff. Kinnikuman, Mari, the Idol Choujins, Meat, and Nachiguron then rest by watching the sunset. Kinnikuman begins to cry at the beautiful display of friendship he witnessed today, so Mari offers him her handkerchief. They almost kiss but are interrupted by a female dinosaur emerging from the ground beneath them and confessing her own feelings for Kinnikuman, ending the film on a comical note with all the characters laughing.",anime child win choujin olympics kinnikuman plan build theme park friend celebrity arrive sky grow dark flash lightning kinnikuman championship belt go see take octopus dragon iii challenge kinnikuman try fail mari kidnap octopus dragon give kinnikuman time limit save feed monster gigasaurus return home world planet metro メトロ星 metoro sei despite injury kinnikuman determined reclaim belt mari luckily terryman ramenman robin mask warsman brocken jr rikishiman arrive lend hand arrival planet metro spot minion octopus dragon series creator yudetamago cameo report octopus dragon send choujin 凶悪超人 villainous superman stop idol choujin advance come harigorasu guard log bridge rikishiman volunteer fight eventually cause fall valley rikishiman manage grab hold wall valley tell kinnikuman time save kinnikuman refuse let wall fall valley meet ninjutsu choujin ukon minion comical scene kinnikuman mishear ukon unko うんこ poop ramenman brocken jr volunteer continue journey continue robin mask warsman volunteer amerug boss minon kinnikuman terryman continue warsman meet tell robin throw enemy erupting volcano warsman end take group enemy urge kinnikuman terryman continue kinnikuman terryman finally find mari immediately challenge octopus dragon tag match mouko seijin broadcast universe fight take place ring electric rope rope power machine octopus dragon minion gammalar turn boss need use rope fierce struggle terryman defeat mouko seijin trademark calf brand shoot gammalar help kinnikuman kinnikuman remember sacrifice friend evoke kajiba kuso djikara defeat octopus dragon fuu rin ka zan follow kinniku buster gammalar try shoot mari gigasaurus mouth kinnikuman knock away catch mari breath octopus dragon release gigasaurus prison monster immediately go kinnikuman mari kinnikuman eat gigasaurus save ramenman rikishiman manage lure beast fall cliff kinnikuman mari idol choujins meat nachiguron rest watch sunset kinnikuman begin cry beautiful display friendship witness today mari offer handkerchief kiss interrupt female dinosaur emerge ground beneath confess feeling kinnikuman end film comical note character laugh
Fido,zombie comedy,"The film takes place in a 1950s-esque alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies. This resulted in the ""Zombie Wars"", where humanity battled zombies to prevent a zombie apocalypse, with humanity the ultimate victor. The radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die turn into the undead, unless the dead body is disposed of by decapitation or cremation. In order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named ZomCon. ZomCon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as menial task servants.
In the town of Willard housewife Helen Robinson (Carrie-Anne Moss) buys a zombie in spite of her husband Bill's (Dylan Baker) zombie phobia, as Bill had to kill his own father who had become a zombie and tried to eat him. Their son, Timmy (K'Sun Ray), befriends the zombie, naming him ""Fido"" (little is revealed of his ""pre-zombie"" life, except that he likely died of myocardial infarction as evidenced by the chest incision). One day, Fido's collar malfunctions and he accidentally kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie. Timmy ""kills"" the zombified neighbor later, but not before she kills and infects another person, causing a small zombie outbreak. ZomCon security forces quell the situation and then investigate what caused the outbreak.
When a pair of local bullies get caught shooting a ZomCon officer they are suspected of shooting the missing neighbor but they point the blame on Fido who hurt them when they tried bullying Timmy. The bullies later capture Fido and Timmy who are out on a walk in the country. Fido escapes and in a parody of Lassie is sent by Timmy to go home and find Helen, who comes and rescues Timmy from the bullies (who, through their own misadventure and Fido's hunger for human flesh, are now zombies), and they try to forget about the whole thing. Several days later, the neighbor's body is 'uncovered' and the murder is traced back to Fido, who is taken away to ZomCon where the family is told he will be destroyed. Timmy learns through Cindy Bottoms (Alexia Fast), daughter of Jonathan Bottoms (Henry Czerny), ZomCon's zealous security chief, that Fido has been put to work in a factory at ZomCon. Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help of Mr. Theopolis (Tim Blake Nelson), a previous Zomcon employee who was forced To leave when it was discovered he was suspected of fraternizing with his attractive female zombie.
Meanwhile, Timmy locates Fido, but is captured by Mr. Bottoms, who attempts to throw Timmy into the zombie-infested ""wild zone"" that exists outside of the fenced communities as punishment for his becoming attached to a zombie. Bill comes to the rescue and is killed in a struggle with Mr. Bottoms, who in turn is killed by Fido. Timmy is set free and the news media states that the ZomCon security breach was the fault of rednecks who venture out into the wild zone to hunt zombies for fun. Helen gives Bill the headless funeral he always wanted in order to prevent his zombification. The film ends with Fido as a surrogate father to Timmy, Helen and Helen's newborn baby. They, along with a few neighbors happily enjoy their new domestic lives together, including the zombified Jonathan Bottoms who is now under the control of his daughter.",zombie comedy film take place esque alternate universe radiation space turn dead zombie result zombie war humanity battle zombie prevent zombie apocalypse humanity ultimate victor radiation plague humanity die turn undead dead body dispose decapitation cremation order continue live normal life community fence help govern corporation name zomcon zomcon provide collar accompany remote control control zombie hunger flesh use menial task servant town willard housewife helen robinson carrie anne moss buy zombie spite husband bill dylan baker zombie phobia bill kill father zombie try eat son timmy ray befriend zombie name fido little reveal pre zombie life likely die myocardial infarction evidence chest incision day fido collar malfunction accidentally kill door neighbor turn zombie timmy kill zombifie neighbor later kill infect person cause small zombie outbreak zomcon security force quell situation investigate cause outbreak pair local bully catch shoot zomcon officer suspect shoot miss neighbor point blame fido hurt tried bully timmy bully later capture fido timmy walk country fido escape parody lassie send timmy home find helen come rescue timmy bully misadventure fido hunger human flesh zombie try forget thing day later neighbor body uncover murder trace fido take away zomcon family tell destroy timmy learn cindy bottom alexia fast daughter jonathan bottoms henry czerny zomcon zealous security chief fido work factory zomcon timmy set rescue help mr theopolis tim blake nelson previous zomcon employee force leave discover suspect fraternize attractive female zombie timmy locate fido capture mr bottoms attempt throw timmy zombie infest wild zone exist outside fence community punishment attach zombie bill come rescue kill struggle mr bottoms turn kill fido timmy set free news media state zomcon security breach fault redneck venture wild zone hunt zombie fun helen give bill headless funeral want order prevent zombification film end fido surrogate father timmy helen helen newborn baby neighbor happily enjoy new domestic life include zombifie jonathan bottom control daughter

Western Union,western,"While surveying a telegraph line in 1861, Western Union engineer Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) is severely injured in an accident. He is discovered by Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), an outlaw on the run from a posse. Forced to travel on foot after his horse was hurt, Shaw at first considers stealing Creighton's horse, but changes his mind and takes the man with him, saving his life.
Sometime later, following his recovery, Creighton returns to Omaha, Nebraska and plans the construction of a telegraph line from Omaha to Salt Lake City, Utah. Facing considerable opposition to the line from Confederate soldiers, Indians, and outlaws, Creighton elicits the help of his sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), foreman Pat Grogan (Minor Watson), and assistant Homer Kettle (Chill Wills).
Looking to put his outlaw past behind him, Shaw arrives at Creighton's Western Union office looking for honest work and is hired as a scout by Grogan who is unaware of his past. Creighton recognizes him among the men and allows him to stay despite his suspicions. Creighton also hires tenderfoot Richard Blake (Robert Young), a Harvard-educated engineer as a favor to Blake's father. Shaw and Blake are both attracted to Sue and vie for her attention, but their romantic rivalry is cut short when construction of the telegraph line starts on July 4, 1861.
After work commences on the line, one of the men is killed apparently by a mysterious band of cattle-rustling Indians. Unconvinced that Indians are to blame, Shaw rides out to investigate and follows the rustlers' trail to the camp of Jack Slade, a former friend and cohort, whose gang committed the killing disguised as Indians—the gang Shaw left following his last bank robbery. Slade reveals that they are working for the Confederacy to disrupt Western Union because they believe the telegraph service will help the Union. Shaw rides away and returns to the line. Not wanting to turn in his former friends, Shaw tells Creighton that a large band of Dakota Indians stole the cattle, and recommends that they simply replace the herd and not risk a fight with the Indians.
Sometime later, a confrontation takes place between men working on the forward line and a band of drunken Indians. When one of the Indians tries to steal some equipment, a nervous Blake shoots him, ignoring Shaw's order to remain calm. After word arrives that the main camp is under attack by other Indians, the Western Union men rush back to help with the defense. At the main camp, Slade's men, who are again disguised as Indians, steal the Western Union horses. The company discover the ruse when one of the wounded Indians turns out to be a white man. Forced to buy back their stolen horses from Slade, Creighton becomes suspicious of Shaw's involvement, especially when he admits to knowing the gang.
Soon the U.S. Army arrives and announces the Indians have now refused to allow the telegraph lines to go through their territory in response to Blake's shooting of the drunken Indian. Creighton, Shaw, and Blake ride out to convince Chief Spotted Horse to allow them to build the line through Indian territory, even though the man Blake wounded was Spotted Horse's son. Creighton is finally able to persuade the Indians to allow them passage, and work continues until the company approaches Salt Lake City.
Sometime later, Shaw receives word that Jack Slade wants to meet with him. On the way to see Slade, Shaw is captured and bound by Slade's men. Slade says his group is going to burn down the Western Union camp and they don't want Shaw to interfere. After Slade and his men ride off, Shaw escapes from his ropes (using the smoldering embers of Slade's campfire),but returns too late to prevent the fire. He helps rescue some of the Western Union men from the flames and burns his hands in the process (or so he lets everyone believe as he burnt them in the campfire).
After the fire, Creighton confronts Shaw for an explanation, but Shaw does not reveal what he knows and is fired by Creighton. As Shaw leaves the camp, he tells Blake that Slade is actually Shaw's brother and that he, Shaw, will find Slade's gang and stop them from interfering with the telegraph project. Shaw rides off and finds Slade and his men in a nearby town. At the barber shop, Shaw confronts his brother, whose gun is concealed under the barber's sheet. Slade shoots Shaw through the sheet. Shaw fights back in spite of his wound, killing some of the gang members, and then dies. Blake arrives and continues the fight with Slade who dies from his wounds. Soon after, the Western Union line is completed and the workers celebrate. When Sue laments the absence of Shaw, Creighton tells her that Shaw can hear them.",western survey telegraph line western union engineer edward creighton dean jagger severely injure accident discover vance shaw randolph scott outlaw run posse force travel foot horse hurt shaw consider steal creighton horse change mind take man save life later follow recovery creighton return omaha nebraska plan construction telegraph line omaha salt lake city utah face considerable opposition line confederate soldier indians outlaws creighton elicit help sister sue virginia gilmore foreman pat grogan minor watson assistant homer kettle chill will look outlaw past shaw arrive creighton western union office look honest work hire scout grogan unaware past creighton recognize man allow stay despite suspicion creighton hire tenderfoot richard blake robert young harvard educate engineer favor blake father shaw blake attract sue vie attention romantic rivalry cut short construction telegraph line start july work commence line man kill apparently mysterious band cattle rustle indians unconvince indians blame shaw ride investigate follow rustler trail camp jack slade friend cohort gang commit killing disguise indians gang shaw leave follow bank robbery slade reveal work confederacy disrupt western union believe telegraph service help union shaw ride away return line want turn friend shaw tell creighton large band dakota indians steal cattle recommend simply replace herd risk fight indians later confrontation take place man work forward line band drunken indians indians try steal equipment nervous blake shoot ignore shaw order remain calm word arrive main camp attack indians western union man rush help defense main camp slade man disguise indians steal western union horse company discover ruse wound indians turn white man force buy steal horse slade creighton suspicious shaw involvement especially admit know gang soon army arrive announce indians refuse allow telegraph line territory response blake shooting drunken indian creighton shaw blake ride convince chief spot horse allow build line indian territory man blake wound spot horse son creighton finally able persuade indians allow passage work continue company approach salt lake city later shaw receive word jack slade want meet way slade shaw capture bind slade man slade say group go burn western union camp want shaw interfere slade man ride shaw escape rope smolder ember slade return late prevent fire help rescue western union man flame burn hand process let believe burn campfire fire creighton confront shaw explanation shaw reveal know fire creighton shaw leave camp tell blake slade actually shaw brother shaw find slade gang stop interfere telegraph project shaw ride find slade man nearby town barber shop shaw confront brother gun conceal barber sheet slade shoot shaw sheet shaw fight spite wound kill gang member die blake arrive continue fight slade die wound soon western union line complete worker celebrate sue lament absence shaw creighton tell shaw hear
Gehrayee,horror,"Chennabasappa (Shriram Lagoo) is a successful high-collar manager of a reputed firm in Bangalore and lives with his very spiritual and rather docile wife Saroja (Indrani Mukherjee), son Nandish (Anant Nag) and daughter Uma (Padmini Kolhapure). Chennabasappa wants to build a house for his family in Bangalore and desperately needs money. He decides to sell his plantation spread across several acres in his ancestral village to a soap company. The plantation has been looked after by Baswa for many years. Baswa is Chennabasappa's loyal servant. Upon knowing Chennabasappa's intentions, Baswa becomes agitated as he considers Chennabasappa's act to be something close to the rape of one's mother. In his view, the piece of land is like one's mother (sign of fertility) that Chennabasappa sold for money.
Chennabasappa is a rationalist, who is more like an atheist and doesn't believe in anything that's beyond sensory perception. He is a hard-headed fellow who is bossy at both office and home. As the story progresses, we see Uma behaving strangely. She would speak something of Chennabasappa's unspeakable and totally unknown dark past. During one such revelation, the family members come to know that Chennabasappa had seduced Baswa's wife while he was a teenager. Baswa's wife got pregnant and jumped into a well to save herself from the horrible Indian society traumas.
Chennabasappa tries every medication and treatment that would bring Uma back to normal, but nothing works out. Unfortunately, the family also becomes the target of several fake exorcists, who start milking them with their evasive talks but do no good to hapless Uma. In one such instance, the family is fooled by a Tantrik Puttachari (Amrish Puri), who actually tries to harness Uma's virginity to resurrect his own devil. However, his plans fail when Nandish interrupts in between and saves Uma.
Finally the family finds peace in the hands of a mighty but sane Tantrik Shashtri (Sudhir Dalvi), who discovers the roots of evil in Chennabasappa's house itself, a spell cast gy lemon and an ugly voodoo doll. Shashtri orders the soul inside Uma's body to reveal its identity and we come to know that the unholy spirit was actually sent to Uma by a village Tantrik whom Baswa paid for this heinous act. Uma turns to normal after few days.
A vengeful Nandish decides to go man to man with Baswa and reaches his ancestral village. He comes to know the Baswa died a few days back. Nandish begs a local Tantrik to help him out meet Baswa's spirit as he is all set to find answers to his questions.",horror chennabasappa shriram lagoo successful high collar manager reputed firm bangalore live spiritual docile wife saroja indrani mukherjee son nandish anant nag daughter uma padmini kolhapure chennabasappa want build house family bangalore desperately need money decide sell plantation spread acre ancestral village soap company plantation look baswa year baswa chennabasappa loyal servant know chennabasappa intention baswa agitated consider chennabasappa act close rape mother view piece land like mother sign fertility chennabasappa sell money chennabasappa rationalist like atheist believe sensory perception hard head fellow bossy office home story progress uma behave strangely speak chennabasappa unspeakable totally unknown dark past revelation family member come know chennabasappa seduce baswa wife teenager baswa wife get pregnant jump save horrible indian society trauma chennabasappa try medication treatment bring uma normal work unfortunately family target fake exorcist start milk evasive talk good hapless uma instance family fool tantrik puttachari amrish puri actually try harness uma virginity resurrect devil plan fail nandish interrupt save uma finally family find peace hand mighty sane tantrik shashtri sudhir dalvi discover root evil chennabasappa house spell cast gy lemon ugly voodoo doll shashtri order soul inside uma body reveal identity come know unholy spirit actually send uma village tantrik baswa pay heinous act uma turn normal day vengeful nandish decide man man baswa reach ancestral village come know baswa die day nandish beg local tantrik help meet baswa spirit set find answer question

Europa Report,science fiction,"Dr. Unger (Embeth Davidtz), CEO of Europa Ventures, narrates the story of the Europa One mission. Six astronauts embark on a privately funded mission to Jupiter's moon Europa to find potential sources of life.[4] The crew members are Captain William Xu (Daniel Wu), pilot Rosa Dasque (Anamaria Marinca), chief science officer Daniel Luxembourg (Christian Camargo), marine biology science officer Katya Petrovna (Karolina Wydra), junior engineer James Corrigan (Sharlto Copley) and chief engineer Andrei Blok (Michael Nyqvist).
After six months of mission time, a solar storm hits the ship, knocking out communication with mission control. Blok and Corrigan perform an EVA to repair the system from outside but an accident rips Blok's suit. While he is being guided back into the airlock, Blok notices that Corrigan's suit has been coated with hydrazine and he cannot enter the airlock or else he would contaminate the rest of the ship. Blok attempts to save Corrigan by taking him out of his suit, but he blacks out from a lack of oxygen. Knowing there is no hope for himself, Corrigan pushes Blok into the airlock, thus propelling himself away from the ship as it continues its journey to Europa. Stranded, he dies in space; the crew continue with the mission, demoralized by Corrigan's death.
After twenty months, the ship lands safely on Europa but misses its target zone. The crew drills through the ice and releases a probe into the underlying sea. Blok, who is sleep-deprived and eliciting concern in the rest of the crew, sees a light outside the ship but he is unable to record it or otherwise convince the crew of its occurrence. The probe is struck by an unknown lighted object and contact with it is lost.
Petrovna insists on collecting samples on Europa's surface; the crew votes and she is allowed to go. Analyzing the samples, Luxembourg discovers traces of a single-celled organism. Petrovna sees a blue light in the distance and decides to investigate it. As she approaches the light the ice below her breaks and she falls through. Her head-mounted camera continues to broadcast, displaying her terrified face as the blue bioluminescence is reflected in her eyes, before cutting out.
The crew agrees to leave to report their discovery to Earth but the engines malfunction. As the ship hurtles back to Europa's surface, Xu unbuckles from his seat to dump water shielding to reduce the impact speed. Remarkably, the ship crashes at the originally-targeted landing site. On impact, Xu is killed and the ship is damaged, leaking oxygen and losing heat. It begins to sink into the ice.
Blok and Luxembourg suit up to make repairs outside the ship. Luxembourg tries to descend but falls through the ice. Blok knows that there is no chance that he alone will be able to repair the ship before it sinks. Instead, he manages to fix the communication system, at the expense of turning off the life support systems, just before the same blue light Petrovna saw approaches and he appears to fall through the ice as well.
Dasque re-establishes communication with Earth. All the collected images and data that have been saved since the solar storm are sent, just as the ice cracks and the ship begins to sink. Alone and anticipating her death, Dasque opens the airlock to flood the ship in hopes of revealing the source of the light. As the water rises to the cockpit, she sees a tentacled, bioluminescent creature[5] rising toward her, before the camera cuts out.
In the epilogue, Unger confirms that the crew of Europa had discovered life and exceeded every expectation, as the footage plays from an earlier scene of the crew posing in front of the camera.",science fiction dr unger embeth davidtz ceo europa venture narrate story europa mission astronaut embark privately fund mission jupiter moon europa find potential source crew member captain william xu daniel wu pilot rosa dasque anamaria marinca chief science officer daniel luxembourg christian camargo marine biology science officer katya petrovna karolina wydra junior engineer james corrigan sharlto copley chief engineer andrei blok michael nyqvist month mission time solar storm hit ship knock communication mission control blok corrigan perform eva repair system outside accident rip blok suit guide airlock blok notice corrigan suit coat hydrazine enter airlock contaminate rest ship blok attempt save corrigan take suit black lack oxygen know hope corrigan push blok airlock propel away ship continue journey europa strand die space crew continue mission demoralize corrigan death month ship land safely europa miss target zone crew drill ice release probe underlie sea blok sleep deprive elicit concern rest crew see light outside ship unable record convince crew occurrence probe strike unknown light object contact lose petrovna insist collect sample europa surface crew vote allow analyze sample luxembourg discover trace single celle organism petrovna see blue light distance decide investigate approach light ice break fall head mount camera continue broadcast display terrified face blue bioluminescence reflect eye cut crew agree leave report discovery earth engine malfunction ship hurtle europa surface xu unbuckle seat dump water shielding reduce impact speed remarkably ship crash originally target landing site impact xu kill ship damage leak oxygen lose heat begin sink ice blok luxembourg suit repair outside ship luxembourg try descend fall ice blok know chance able repair ship sink instead manage fix communication system expense turn life support system blue light petrovna see approach appear fall ice dasque establishes communication earth collect image datum save solar storm send ice crack ship begin sink anticipate death dasque open airlock flood ship hope reveal source light water rise cockpit see tentacled bioluminescent rise camera cut epilogue unger confirm crew europa discover life exceed expectation footage play early scene crew pose camera
Step Up 2: The Streets,dance,"In Baltimore, Maryland, Andrea ""Andie"" West pursues her dream of becoming a street dancer. After her mother died from cancer, Andie moved in with her mother's best friend, Sarah. Deep down Andie feels like she does not belong anywhere. Although she is doing poorly at school, it is her dream for dancing that brings something special into her life. She trains with her dance crew, 410 to keep the title of the illegal competition, ""The Streets"". Sarah is aware of the crime and harassment by 410 and out of fear that Andie will get hurt, she decides to send her to live with her aunt in Texas in an effort to protect Andie, but Andie refuses to go and runs away.
Tyler Gage who is like a big brother to Andie sees her at a local dance club, The Dragon. When Andie tells him about Sarah's plans to send her to Texas to live with her aunt Tyler explains that Sarah's trying to keep Andie safe. He tries to persuade Andie to audition for the Maryland School of the Arts, where Andie has to compete for a place, thinking it will help her life as it did his. Tyler decides to battle her for it. Tyler wins the battle and the two head back to Andie's house where Tyler asks Sarah to let her audition for MSA. Sarah refuses because she believes that Andie will be safer in Texas. Tyler eventually persuades Sarah to let Andie audition for MSA while he goes on tour with Nora Clark, the girl from the original Step Up. Sarah reluctantly agrees, but she tells Andie that if she screws up with MSA she'll have to go to Texas. Chase Collins persuades his brother, Director Blake Collins to recruit Andie after seeing her audition. When 410 learns about Andie's involvement at MSA, they kick her out. Chase and Andie form a new crew with help from many people Chase knows at the school, all of not accepted as who they are, including Andie's new friend Moose. Chase has a copied key to the studio and the crew secretly practices their routine late at night when the school is empty. They perform at the local dance club, but are rejected and kicked out. Andie's best friend Missy Serrano joins the crew after leaving 410 following the event, as she is disgusted by the crowd's reaction. Missy tells the crew that the only way to enter The Streets is to first pull a prank and post it on the Internet to show that the crew is entering the competition. Wanting revenge for being humiliated before, Chase decides that their prank will be to make a fool out of Tuck, the leader of 410.
The crew goes to a family barbecue at Missy's house. Sophie, an MSA student who happens to have a crush on Chase, tags along. She begins to develop a crush on Moose after salsa dancing with him. 410 doesn't like the fact that they have a new crew to compete with so they warn Andie's group to stay out of The Streets or there will be consequences. When Tuck finds Chase, he assaults him for his prank and warns him to stay away from The Streets and Andie. Chase comes into school the next day badly bruised and hurt. On top of that, the dance studio has been trashed by 410 the previous night. Director Blake forbids the students from the school to be involved in illegal competitions and expels Andie from MSA for her involvement with The Streets competition, but Andie denies the involvement of her other members. After she leaves, Chase admits his involvement in The Streets and tries to persuade Director Blake to let Andie back in, but Director Blake refuses as he is too busy with the fundraiser.
When Sarah hears the news of Andie's expulsion, Andie tries to explain, but Sarah refuses to listen. Sarah tells her that she has had enough of her behavior and now Andie must go live with her aunt in Texas. Just when Andie is packing her bags to leave, she receives a text message from Missy that The Streets is on the same night as the MSA fundraiser. Along with Andie, her whole crew gets the text message. They decide to ditch the MSA fundraiser and instead compete in The Streets. Chase also leaves the fundraiser hoping to win back Andie. When Sarah hears about what Andie did to protect her crew she allows Andie to continue living with her and lets her compete at The Streets with her crew. Sarah does ground Andie.
When Director Blake notices that his students are gone, he questions Sophie. Moose tells him that he is in the crew and where they are. Moose takes both Director Blake and Sophie to the place; they are just in time for the crew's performance. The Director sees them and he realizes that The Streets he was hearing and thinking about, is in fact a legitimate form of artistic expression. He accepts Andie into MSA again and tells Moose that he was in the wrong department. To Moose's surprise, he gets kissed by Sophie. With Andie's crew being supportive friends and her education now secured, the film ends with a passionate kiss between Chase and Andie.",dance baltimore maryland andrea andie west pursue dream street dancer mother die cancer andie move mother good friend sarah deep andie feel like belong poorly school dream dancing bring special life train dance crew title illegal competition street sarah aware crime harassment fear andie hurt decide send live aunt texas effort protect andie andie refuse run away tyler gage like big brother andie see local dance club dragon andie tell sarah plan send texas live aunt tyler explain sarah try andie safe try persuade andie audition maryland school art andie compete place think help life tyler decide battle tyler win battle head andie house tyler ask sarah let audition msa sarah refuse believe andie safe texas tyler eventually persuade sarah let andie audition msa go tour nora clark girl original step sarah reluctantly agree tell andie screw msa texas chase collins persuade brother director blake collins recruit andie see audition learn andie involvement msa kick chase andie form new crew help people chase know school accept include andie new friend moose chase copy key studio crew secretly practice routine late night school perform local dance club reject kick andie good friend missy serrano join crew leave follow event disgust crowd reaction missy tell crew way enter street pull prank post internet crew enter competition want revenge humiliate chase decide prank fool tuck leader crew go family barbecue missy house sophie msa student happen crush chase tag begin develop crush moose salsa dance like fact new crew compete warn andie group stay street consequence tuck find chase assault prank warn stay away street andie chase come school day badly bruise hurt dance studio trash previous night director blake forbid student school involve illegal competition expel andie msa involvement street competition andie deny involvement member leave chase admit involvement street try persuade director blake let andie director blake refuse busy fundraiser sarah hear news andie expulsion andie try explain sarah refuse listen sarah tell behavior andie live aunt texas andie pack bag leave receive text message missy street night msa fundraiser andie crew get text message decide ditch msa fundraiser instead compete street chase leave fundraiser hope win andie sarah hear andie protect crew allow andie continue live let compete street crew sarah ground andie director blake notice student go question sophie moose tell crew moose take director blake sophie place time crew performance director see realize street hear think fact legitimate form artistic expression accept andie msa tell moose wrong department moose surprise get kiss sophie andie crew supportive friend education secure film end passionate kiss chase andie
Raaz 3,adult/suspense/thriller,"The story revolves around Shanaya (Bipasha Basu), an actress at the height of her success. She gets offered the best roles and wins all the awards she is nominated for. In addition, she also has a passionate affair with a handsome director named Aditya (Emraan Hashmi). This all ends when a younger actress, Sanjana (Esha Gupta) entered the film industry. In place of Shanaya, Sanjana comes into spotlight and begins to snatch away her awards. Suddenly, Shanaya seems forgotten and everybody only wants to work with Sanjana. Soon enough, Shanaya sees her career fading away and her envy slowly becomes craziness. She begins to turn to black magic and makes it her goal in life to destroy Sanjana's career and make her the pain of loss.
She seeks help of her uncle sonu (Sunil Dhariwal), a tantrik who helps her to practice black magic and calls upon an evil entity, Tara Dutt (Manish Choudhary). She asks him to make Sanjana's life a living hell. Tara agrees to help haunt and torture Sanjana until she becomes suicidal. He asks Shanaya to give her a black poison through a person she trusts. Shanaya seduces Aditya to do it for her and whenever he feels guilty, she makes him accept again. Aditya, whose sympathy for Sanjana has turned into love, leaves Shanaya and refuses to listen her any more. Now Shanaya must work on her own to defeat the power of love.
Somehow, to try to end Aditya and Sanjana's love triangle, Shanaya hatches a plan by befriending Sanjana in order to poison her which Aditya gets suspicious about. At a movie premiere, Shanaya reveals that she actually hid the poison in the chocolate basket she gave to Sanjana earlier. In the bathroom, Sanjana is attacked by a swarm of moths that cause her to strip naked of her dress and run back into the party, thus getting exposed by the paparazzi. Her career is ultimately ruined as the public wrongly believed this to be a deliberate publicity stunt of hers. Aditya takes her to the Hospital and finds out that Shanaya was behind this. In rage, Aditya visits Shanaya's house and damages her things, taking away the last bit of the poisonous water. Agitated, Shanaya seeks Tara Dutt's help again, wanting to kill Sanjana. Tara Dutt tells Shanaya that life and death are in God's hands and that to fight God he'll need her life force. He tells Shanaya that she has to have sex with him to enable Tara to become powerful, to which Shanaya agrees. At the hospital, with the help of the doctor and a saint, Aditya goes into the spirit world to fight Tara Dutt, defeating him and rescuing Sanjana's soul. Back in the real world, Shanaya suffers damage as a result of the fight between Tara Dutt and Aditya and attempts to kill Aditya and Sanjana, only to meet failure.

Sitting Bull,western,"Major Robert Parrish (Dale Robertson) of the 7th Cavalry is considered by some to be his own worst enemy because he's not a ""team player"". Formerly one of the youngest Colonels in the Union Army during the American Civil War, he is now a company commander under Lt. Colonel (formerly Brevet Major General during the Civil War) George Armstrong Custer (Douglas Kennedy). His fiancée Kathy (Mary Murphy), daughter of Parrish's commanding general, breaks off their engagement because he has not risen in rank.
Parrish gains no friends amongst the civilian community when he chastises them and threatens to ""break heads"" when they violate Sioux lands. Custer and Parrish's exasperated General and once prospective father-in-law reassigns Parrish and his company to the Bureau of Indian Affairs where Parrish is outraged at the treatment of the Indians and refuses to carry out the orders of the Indian Agent to shoot his escaping charges. Parrish is court martialed and visits his former commanding general--now President of the United States--Ulysses S. Grant--who demotes him to Captain. Parrish convinces the President to come to the Western frontier to meet Sitting Bull and prevent a war.
Back in the West, now Captain Parrish meets Kathy who has announced her engagement with Charles Wentworth (William Hopper), a former major and now a war correspondent. Using captured Indians, including Sam, a former slave now a Sioux, Parrish meets with Sitting Bull (J. Carrol Naish) who agrees to meet the President in a secret meeting. Further conflicts with the Sioux lead Custer to lead his Regiment out assigning Parrish to guard supplies.

Left Right and Centre,comedy/romance,"Robert Wilcot, a popular television personality, is selected as the Conservative candidate for the provincial town of Earndale in the upcoming by-election. His selection is mostly due to the influence of his uncle, Lord Wilcot a powerful local figure. His opponent is to be Stella Stoker, a fishmonger's daughter with a degree from the London School of Economics who has been chosen to stand for the Labour Party.
Travelling up on the train to Earndale, the two candidates meet and while she quickly works out who he is, he remains ignorant of her true identity. To try to show off he begins to tell her about his selection for the seat and how he expects to win. He describes his opponent as a bluestocking. He also inadvertently reveals embarrassing details to her such as the fact that he has scarcely been to Earndale in his life and that his family once controlled the seat as a rotten borough. Once they arrive at Earndale station, he is soon made aware of his mistake. The electoral agents of both candidates are furious to discover they have been fraternising on the train.
Wilcot goes to visit his uncle, and finds him to be an eccentric who has turned his country house into a money-making operation for visiting coach parties of tourists. It appears that he has engineered Robert Wilcot's selection as a candidate in order to spark public interest in the election, boosting his own business. It is also clear that the political contest is added to by the enmity of the two electoral agents the Tory Harding-Pratt and Labour's Bert Glimmer.
Once on the stump the two candidates keep running into each other around Earndale, at one point during a factory visit leading to a shouting match. Both begin to become entranced by the other, and become convinced they are falling in love. This comes to a head during the hustings at Wilcot Hall where they are caught embracing in the maze by their respective agents. Burying the hatchet, the two agents try to foil the potential romance. Despite repeated attempts to break up the candidates they continue a covert relationship.",comedy romance robert wilcot popular television personality select conservative candidate provincial town earndale upcoming election selection influence uncle lord wilcot powerful local figure opponent stella stoker fishmonger daughter degree london school economic choose stand labour party travel train earndale candidate meet quickly work remain ignorant true identity try begin tell selection seat expect win describe opponent bluestocking inadvertently reveal embarrassing detail fact scarcely earndale life family control seat rotten borough arrive earndale station soon aware mistake electoral agent candidate furious discover fraternise train wilcot go visit uncle find eccentric turn country house money make operation visit coach party tourist appear engineer robert wilcot selection candidate order spark public interest election boost business clear political contest add enmity electoral agent tory harding pratt labour bert glimmer stump candidate run earndale point factory visit lead shouting match begin entrance convinced fall love come head husting wilcot hall catch embrace maze respective agent bury hatchet agent try foil potential romance despite repeat attempt break candidate continue covert relationship
National Lampoon's European Vacation,comedy,"The Griswald family competes in a game show called Pig in a Poke and wins an all-expenses-paid trip to Europe. In a whirlwind tour of western Europe, chaos of all sorts ensues. They stay in a fleabag London hotel with a sloppy, tattooed Cockney desk clerk. While in their English rental car, a yellow Austin Maxi, Clark drives the family around the busy Lambeth Bridge roundabout for hours, unable to maneuver his way out of traffic. His tendency to drive on the wrong side of the road causes frequent accidents, including knocking over a bicyclist, who reappears throughout the film. At Stonehenge, Clark backs the car into an ancient stone monolith, toppling all the stones like dominoes, which they do not even notice as they happily leave the scene.
In Paris, the family wears stenciled berets, causing Rusty to be teased by young women at the Eiffel Tower observation deck. Clark offers to get rid of the beret for Rusty, but when he throws it away, another visitor's dachshund mistakes it for a Frisbee and jumps off the tower after it. The family's video camera is stolen by a passerby whom Clark had asked to take a picture of the family. Clark also mocked by a French waiter for his terrible French. Later, Clark and Ellen visit a bawdy Paris can-can dance show, finding Rusty already there with a prostitute.
Next, in a West German village, the Griswalds burst in on a bewildered elderly couple, who they mistakenly think are relatives but who end up providing them dinner and lodging anyway, not being able to understand the other's language. Clark turns a lively Bavarian folk dance stage performance into an all-out street brawl, after which, while fleeing, he hastily knocks down several street vendors' stands and gets their Citroën DS stuck in a narrow medieval archway.
In Rome, the Griswalds rent a car at a travel office, but unknown to them, the men in charge are thieves, holding the real manager captive. The lead thief gives them a car with the manager in the trunk, claiming he lost the trunk keys. The next day Ellen is shocked to discover that private, sexy videos of her from the family's stolen video camera have been used in a billboard advertising porn, leaving her completely humiliated. After screaming angrily at Clark (who had told her he had erased the video), Ellen storms off to their hotel, where she encounters the thief who rented them the car. She confesses her recent troubles, still unaware that he is a criminal. The man then tries to get the car keys, which are in her purse, but fails. When the police arrive at the hotel, he kidnaps Ellen, prompting Clark to rescue her. On the flight back to the U.S., Clark accidentally causes the plane to knock the Statue of Liberty's torch upside down.",comedy griswald family compete game call pig poke win expense pay trip europe whirlwind tour western europe chaos sort ensue stay fleabag london hotel sloppy tattooed cockney desk clerk english rental car yellow austin maxi clark drive family busy lambeth bridge roundabout hour unable maneuver way traffic tendency drive wrong road cause frequent accident include knock bicyclist reappear film stonehenge clark back car ancient stone monolith topple stone like domino notice happily leave scene paris family wear stencil beret cause rusty tease young woman eiffel tower observation deck clark offer rid beret rusty throw away visitor dachshund mistake frisbee jump tower family video camera steal passerby clark ask picture family clark mock french waiter terrible french later clark ellen visit bawdy paris dance find rusty prostitute west german village griswald burst bewildered elderly couple mistakenly think relative end provide dinner lodge able understand language clark turn lively bavarian folk dance stage performance street brawl flee hastily knock street vendor stand get citroën ds stick narrow medieval archway rome griswald rent car travel office unknown man charge thief hold real manager captive lead thief give car manager trunk claim lose trunk key day ellen shock discover private sexy video family steal video camera billboard advertise porn leave completely humiliate scream angrily clark tell erase video ellen storm hotel encounter thief rent car confess recent trouble unaware criminal man try car key purse fail police arrive hotel kidnap ellen prompt clark rescue flight clark accidentally cause plane knock statue liberty torch upside
Seabiscuit,"drama, biography","Three men, Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), Charles S. Howard (Jeff Bridges), and Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) come together as the principal jockey, owner, and trainer of the championship horse Seabiscuit, rising from troubled times to achieve fame and success through their association with the horse.
Red is the child of a Canadian family financially ruined by the Great Depression. In desperate need of money, the family leaves Red with a horse trainer. Red eventually becomes a jockey, but makes extra money through illegal boxing matches which left him blind in one eye. Howard is a clerk in a bicycle shop who gets asked by a passing motorist to repair his automobile, a technology which has recently been introduced. As a result, Howard becomes knowledgeable enough with automobiles to increase their performance and sell them as a dealer, eventually becoming the largest car dealer in California and one of the Bay Area's richest men. However, his son is killed in an automobile accident while driving the family car, which sends Howard into a bout of deep depression, which eventually results in his wife (Valerie Mahaffey) leaving him.
On a trip to Mexico to obtain a divorce, he meets Marcela Zabala (Elizabeth Banks). After marrying Marcela, Howard acquires a stable of horses and later has a chance encounter with the skilled and kindly horse trainer and drifter Smith. Howard hires Smith to manage his stables after Smith, who specializes in rehabilitating injured and abused horses, explains to Howard ""You don't throw a whole life away just 'cause it's banged up a little bit"". Smith convinces Howard to acquire the colt ""Seabiscuit"", who comes from noted lineage but had been deemed ""incorrigible"" by past handlers and was later broken and trained to lose against better horses.
Smith is unable to find a jockey willing to deal with Seabiscuit's temperament, but after witnessing Red Pollard brawling with other stable boys, he sees in him a similar temperament to the feisty horse and decides to appoint him as Seabiscuit's jockey. Seabiscuit and Pollard become close and they begin to race. After overcoming early difficulties, such as a dismissive media and Pollard's anger issues and blind eye, Seabiscuit begins to earn considerable success and becomes an extremely popular underdog for the millions affected by the Great Depression. Inspired, Howard tries repeatedly to provoke a race with the mocking New York tycoon Samuel Riddle and his fearsome stallion ""War Admiral"", the top race horse in the country. Riddle eventually relents to a match race on his terms between War Admiral and Seabiscuit, but while the date approaches, Pollard is injured in a riding accident, fracturing his leg. When the doctor reports that he will be unable to ride again, Red suggests that Howard get an old friend, the successful jockey George Woolf (Gary Stevens) to be Seabiscuit's new rider.
Red teaches Woolf about Seabiscuit's handling and mannerisms. At the match race, Seabiscuit upsets the heavy favorite, War Admiral, partly because of a secret that Pollard relates to Woolf, instructing him to hold him head to head with the other horse so he gets ""a good look at the Admiral"". Later on, Seabiscuit is racing at Santa Anita when he is injured and has to stop. Red helps him to recover and get fit enough to race again. The last race is again at the Santa Anita, and Red rides him this time after putting a special self-made brace on his own leg to keep it stable. Woolf is on a different horse. Seabiscuit drops to last place and trails the pack, but Woolf holds back to be alongside Red and let Seabiscuit ""get a good look"". After a short conversation, Seabiscuit surges and wins the race.
Red says, ""You know, everybody thinks that we found this broken down horse and fixed him, but we didn't. He fixed us. Every one of us. And I guess in a way, we kinda fixed each other, too""",drama biography man red pollard tobey maguire charles howard jeff bridges tom smith chris cooper come principal jockey owner trainer championship horse seabiscuit rise troubled time achieve fame success association horse red child canadian family financially ruin great depression desperate need money family leave red horse trainer red eventually jockey make extra money illegal boxing match leave blind eye howard clerk bicycle shop get ask pass motorist repair automobile technology recently introduce result howard knowledgeable automobile increase performance sell dealer eventually large car dealer california bay area rich man son kill automobile accident drive family car send howard bout deep depression eventually result wife valerie mahaffey leave trip mexico obtain divorce meet marcela zabala elizabeth bank marrying marcela howard acquire stable horse later chance encounter skilled kindly horse trainer drifter smith howard hire smith manage stable smith specialize rehabilitate injure abuse horse explain howard throw life away bang little bit smith convinces howard acquire colt seabiscuit come noted lineage deem incorrigible past handler later break train lose well horse smith unable find jockey willing deal seabiscuit temperament witness red pollard brawl stable boy see similar temperament feisty horse decide appoint seabiscuit jockey seabiscuit pollard close begin race overcome early difficulty dismissive medium pollard anger issue blind eye seabiscuit begin earn considerable success extremely popular underdog million affect great depression inspire howard try repeatedly provoke race mocking new york tycoon samuel riddle fearsome stallion war admiral race horse country riddle eventually relent match race term war admiral seabiscuit date approach pollard injure riding accident fracture leg doctor report unable ride red suggest howard old friend successful jockey george woolf gary stevens seabiscuit new rider red teach woolf seabiscuit handling mannerism match race seabiscuit upset heavy favorite war admiral partly secret pollard relate woolf instruct hold head head horse get good look admiral later seabiscuit race santa anita injure stop red help recover fit race race santa anita red ride time put special self brace leg stable woolf different horse seabiscuit drop place trail pack woolf hold alongside red let seabiscuit good look short conversation seabiscuit surge win race red say know everybody think find break horse fix fix guess way kinda fix
19,"sumanth, kamalinee mukherjee","Godavari is a film about Sreeram, Seeta and the river cruise from Rajamundry to Bhadrachalam that brings them together. It is a semi-urban love story set against the scenic backdrop of the Godavari river aboard a houseboat also called ""Godavari"".[4]
Sreeram, also Ram (Sumanth) finishes his masters from United States but wishes to serve the people by entering the politics. He lives with his grandmother. He's in love with his cousin Raji (Neetu Chandra) and hopes to marry her. Raji's father (CVL Narasimha Rao) often expresses his dislike towards Ram's professional interests and his financial status. And for the same reason he does not want to marry off his daughter to him. Meanwhile, Seetha (Kamalinee) is a fashion designer who runs an unsuccessful clothing boutique. Her parents are not very keen about her business and want her to get married instead. Seetha, being an independent woman who wants to succeed in her life, is not enthusiastic about the idea; however, circumstances force her to reluctantly agree with her parents. Unfortunately, the marriage alliance doesn't work out as the groom's family feels that she is 'progressive and fast'. To take a break from everything she plans to go on a boat journey to Bhadrachalam.
Meanwhile, Raji gets a marriage proposal from Ravi (Kamal Kamaraju), a self-centred IPS officer. Raji conveys that she's not sure about her feelings for Ram. Taking that as a challenge, Ram says that he will prove his worth to her father and win her hand. He works on a project with a company and earns 1 lakh rupees. The happy and excited Ram, rushes to share this news with Raji. But soon realises that she has already agreed to marry Ravi and remains silent. A heartbroken but realistic Ram is forced to join his family on the river journey to Bhadrachalam, where Raji is to get married. It is on this boat cruise that Ram and Seetha meet. There are also several sub stories involving the other characters on the boat house. Along with Ram, his family and Seeta, the others on the ship include:
Ram and Seeta meet each for the first time when she is walking the ramp that leads to the ship from the shore with great difficulty. Ram who is behind her on the plank lifts her in his arms, walks through the ramp and releases her on the boat. According to him her easing her efforts while Seeta demands him for an apology for touching her without her permission. The easy-going Ram apologises and proceeds. And their next meeting is on the boat's deck, both reading books and munching chips. Seeta mistakes Ram's pack of chips for hers and eats them greedily. And both start pulling and tugging the pack, until she leaves the deck with the chips. After seeing her chips in her room cabin she realizes her stupidity and returns the new pack to Ram, where they officially meet each other. He salutes her with a half-Namaste with this right hand held on his chest. During the journey, Pullamma's brother sings a song and gets tipped by Ram. Pullamma gets offended by this and rejects to give pullattlu to Ram. Seeta brings extra pullattlu for him and they have breakfast on the edge plank of the boat hanging their feet in the water and get to know about each other.
Seeta starts writing a diary to record her memories on her trip and she starts it with Ram. And the relation between Ram and Seeta goes through ups and down all through the journey. She tries to woo Ram many times by wearing sari as she has observed him earlier staring at his cousin, Raji who looked stunning in a white sari. During a halt in their journey, the owner organizes a treasure-hunt and they both team up as one. All through the event, Seeta tries to find Ram's feelings for her, but he simply nods and smiles; neither accepting nor rejecting her. They will be just one step away from the treasure and just ahead of Chinna and Kotigadu who are another team. Seeta asks Ram to let them win, thus earning Ram's admiration. Meanwhile, Raji and Ravi's team are lost in the hunt as Raji misguides at a point. And she finds out about Ravi that he doesn't have much expectation from his wife.
A disappointed Raji asks Ram to marry her. Ram says he is going to pick her up at a specific location and plans to send it through Chinna. Seeta and Raji secretly stay behind letting the boat leave them along with the astrologer. Chinna swallows the chit given to him by Ram as he is well aware of the affection of Seeta for Ram. Raji along with others waits at a shore as she is told by Seeta that he would come and pick her up from there. But Ram never turns up, instead boat returns to get them as they find them missing. Seeing this Raji asks Seeta not to say the family about the eloping plan and simply covers up that they were lost sight seeing. By seeing that Ram still chooses to marry Raji, Seeta gets deeply hurt and leaves the boat after reaching Badrachalam.
After the wedding, Ram misses Seeta and visits her room on their return journey. There he finds her diary and understands her feelings for him. He goes to her place to speak with her. After pursuing for a long time, she agrees to take a walk with him where he proposes her for marriage and explains her that the chit meant to given to Raji about the location was blank, meaning he never had the intention of marrying her. Listening to this, Seeta is all happy and after making the promise that if in future she seeks his favours, he would confront Raji, rather than sympathising her.",sumanth kamalinee mukherjee godavari film sreeram seeta river cruise rajamundry bhadrachalam bring semi urban love story set scenic backdrop godavari river aboard houseboat call sreeram ram sumanth finish master united states wish serve people enter politic live grandmother love cousin raji neetu chandra hope marry raji father cvl narasimha rao express dislike ram professional interest financial status reason want marry daughter seetha kamalinee fashion designer run unsuccessful clothing boutique parent keen business want marry instead seetha independent woman want succeed life enthusiastic idea circumstance force reluctantly agree parent unfortunately marriage alliance work groom family feel progressive fast break plan boat journey bhadrachalam raji get marriage proposal ravi kamal kamaraju self centre ips officer raji convey sure feeling ram take challenge ram say prove worth father win hand work project company earn lakh rupee happy excited ram rush share news raji soon realise agree marry ravi remain silent heartbroken realistic ram force join family river journey bhadrachalam raji marry boat cruise ram seetha meet sub story involve character boat house ram family seeta ship include ram seeta meet time walk ramp lead ship shore great difficulty ram plank lift arm walk ramp release boat accord ease effort seeta demand apology touch permission easy go ram apologise proceed meeting boat deck read book munch chip seeta mistake ram pack chip eat greedily start pull tug pack leave deck chip see chip room cabin realize stupidity return new pack ram officially meet salute half namaste right hand hold chest journey pullamma brother sing song get tip ram pullamma get offend reject pullattlu ram seeta bring extra pullattlu breakfast edge plank boat hang foot water know seeta start write diary record memory trip start ram relation ram seeta go up journey try woo ram time wear sari observe early stare cousin raji look stunning white sari halt journey owner organize treasure hunt team event seeta try find ram feeling simply nod smile accept reject step away treasure ahead chinna kotigadu team seeta ask ram let win earn ram admiration raji ravi team lose hunt raji misguide point find ravi expectation wife disappointed raji ask ram marry ram say go pick specific location plan send chinna seeta raji secretly stay let boat leave astrologer chinna swallow chit give ram aware affection seeta ram raji wait shore tell seeta come pick ram turn instead boat return find miss see raji ask seeta family eloping plan simply cover lose sight seeing see ram choose marry raji seeta get deeply hurt leave boat reach badrachalam wedding ram miss seeta visit room return journey find diary understand feeling go place speak pursue long time agree walk propose marriage explain chit mean give raji location blank mean intention marry listen seeta happy make promise future seek favour confront raji sympathise
William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,drama,"In Verona Beach, the Capulets and the Montagues are arch-rivals.[6] The animosity of the older generation—Fulgencio and Gloria Capulet and Ted and Caroline Montague—is felt by their younger relatives. A gunfight between the Montague boys led by Benvolio, Romeo's cousin, and the Capulet boys led by Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, creates chaos in the city. The Chief of Police, Captain Prince, reprimands the families, warning them that if such behavior continues, their lives ""shall pay the forfeit of the peace"".
Benvolio meets Romeo on a beach. While playing a game of pool they learn of a party being held by the Capulets that evening which they decide to gate-crash. Romeo agrees to come after discovering that Rosaline, with whom he is in love, is attending. Later, the Montague boys meet their friend, Mercutio, who has tickets to the party. Romeo takes ecstasy Mercutio gave him and they proceed to the Capulet mansion. The effects of the drug and the party overwhelm Romeo, who goes to the restroom. While admiring an aquarium, he sees Juliet on the other side, and the two instantly fall in love. Tybalt spots Romeo and vows to kill him for invading his family's home, but Fulgencio stops him.
Romeo and Juliet sneak into an elevator and kiss. The nurse spots them when the doors open and drags Juliet away, telling her that Romeo is a Montague. At the same time, Romeo realizes that Juliet is a Capulet. Mercutio takes Romeo from the party, but he sneaks back to the mansion, hiding under Juliet’s balcony. Juliet emerges into the courtyard and proclaims her love for Romeo before he sneaks up behind her. Juliet warns him that he is risking his life, but Romeo tells her he doesn't care whether he is caught. Knowing her nurse is looking for her, Juliet tells him that, if he sends word by the following day, they will be betrothed. The next day, Romeo visits Father Laurence, telling him he wants to marry Juliet. He agrees to marry the pair in hopes that their marriage will end the violence between the families. Romeo passes the word on to Juliet’s nurse and the lovers are married.
Tybalt encounters Mercutio at the beach just as Romeo arrives. Romeo attempts to make peace, but Tybalt assaults him. Mercutio intervenes and batters Tybalt, and is about to finish him off when Romeo stops him. Tybalt then slashes Mercutio with a shard of glass in his stomach. Mercutio curses both the Montagues and the Capulets before dying in Romeo's arms. Enraged, Romeo chases after a fleeing Tybalt and guns him down.
Captain Prince banishes Romeo from the city. Romeo goes into hiding with Father Laurence, who treats his injuries and says that, after some time passes, he will help Romeo and Juliet return to the city and reconcile with their family and friends. The nurse arrives and tells Romeo that Juliet is waiting for him. When Romeo climbs over Juliet's balcony, she kisses him and they consummate their marriage. Meanwhile, Fulgencio decides Juliet will marry Dave Paris, the governor's son.
The next morning, Romeo narrowly escapes the Capulet mansion as Gloria tells Juliet that the family has promised she will marry Paris. She refuses, and Fulgencio threatens to disown her. Her mother and nurse insist it would be in her best interest to marry Paris. To get out of this, Juliet runs away and seeks out Father Laurence, imploring him to help her and threatening to commit suicide. Father Laurence proposes she fake her own death and be put in the Capulet vault to awaken 24 hours later. Romeo will be told of the plot, sneak into the vault, and once reunited the two can escape to Mantua. He gives her a potion which mimics death. After saying goodnight to her mother, Juliet drinks the potion and slips into a coma. She is found in the morning, declared dead, and placed in the vault. Balthasar, one of Romeo's cousins, learns that Juliet is dead and tells Romeo, who is not home when the messenger arrives with a letter from Father Laurence.
Romeo returns to Verona and buys a vial of poison. As he goes to the church, Captain Prince finds out he is back, and tries to capture him, without success. Father Laurence learns that Romeo never got his letter and has no idea Juliet is alive. Romeo enters the church where Juliet lies and bids her goodbye. She awakens just as Romeo takes the poison; the two thus see each other and share a final kiss before he dies. A distraught Juliet picks up Romeo's gun and shoots herself in the head, dying instantly. The two lovers are soon discovered in each other's arms. Prince condemns both families, whose feuding led to such tragedy, while coroners quickly transport the two bodies to the morgue.",drama verona beach capulet montague arch animosity old generation fulgencio gloria capulet ted caroline montague feel young relative gunfight montague boy lead benvolio romeo cousin capulet boy lead tybalt juliet cousin create chaos city chief police captain prince reprimand family warn behavior continue life shall pay forfeit peace benvolio meet romeo beach play game pool learn party hold capulet evening decide gate crash romeo agree come discover rosaline love attend later montague boy meet friend mercutio ticket party romeo take ecstasy mercutio give proceed capulet mansion effect drug party overwhelm romeo go restroom admire aquarium see juliet instantly fall love tybalt spot romeo vow kill invade family home fulgencio stop romeo juliet sneak elevator kiss nurse spot door open drag juliet away tell romeo montague time romeo realize juliet capulet mercutio take romeo party sneak mansion hide juliet balcony juliet emerge courtyard proclaim love romeo sneak juliet warn risk life romeo tell care catch know nurse look juliet tell send word follow day betroth day romeo visit father laurence tell want marry juliet agree marry pair hope marriage end violence family romeo pass word juliet nurse lover marry tybalt encounter mercutio beach romeo arrive romeo attempt peace tybalt assault mercutio intervene batter tybalt finish romeo stop tybalt slash mercutio shard glass stomach mercutio curse montague capulet die romeo arm enraged romeo chase flee tybalt gun captain prince banish romeo city romeo go hiding father laurence treat injury say time pass help romeo juliet return city reconcile family friend nurse arrive tell romeo juliet wait romeo climb juliet balcony kiss consummate marriage fulgencio decide juliet marry dave paris governor son morning romeo narrowly escape capulet mansion gloria tell juliet family promise marry paris refuse fulgencio threaten disown mother nurse insist good interest marry paris juliet run away seek father laurence implore help threaten commit suicide father laurence propose fake death capulet vault awaken hour later romeo tell plot sneak vault reunite escape mantua give potion mimic death say goodnight mother juliet drink potion slip coma find morning declare dead place vault balthasar romeo cousin learn juliet dead tell romeo home messenger arrive letter father laurence romeo return verona buy vial poison go church captain prince find try capture success father laurence learn romeo get letter idea juliet alive romeo enter church juliet lie bid goodbye awaken romeo take poison share final kiss die distraught juliet pick romeo gun shoot head die instantly lover soon discover arm prince condemn family feuding lead tragedy coroner quickly transport body morgue

White Heat,film noir,"Arthur ""Cody"" Jarrett is a ruthless, psychotic criminal and leader of the Jarrett gang. Although married to Verna, he is overly attached to his equally crooked and determined mother, ""Ma"" Jarrett, his only true confidante.
Cody and his gang rob a mail train in the Sierra Nevada, resulting in the deaths of four members of the train crew. With the help of informants, the authorities close in on a motor court in Los Angeles where Cody, Verna and Ma are holed up. Cody shoots and wounds US Treasury investigator Philip Evans and makes his escape. He then comes up with a scheme: to confess to a lesser crime committed in Springfield, Illinois, which an associate committed at the same time as the train robbery, thus providing him with a false alibi. He turns himself in and is sent back to Illinois, where he receives a one to three-year sentence in state prison. This does not fool Evans, however, who plants undercover agent Hank Fallon (aka Vic Pardo) in Cody's cell in the Illinois State Penitentiary. His task is to find the ""Trader"", a fence who launders stolen money for Cody.
On the outside, ""Big Ed"" Somers, Cody's ambitious right-hand man, takes charge of the gang. Verna betrays Cody and joins Ed, feeling assured Cody will never make it out of prison because Big Ed has paid Roy Parker, an inmate, to kill Cody. In the prison workshop, Parker drops a heavy piece of machinery on Cody, but Hank pushes him out of the way, saving his life. Ma visits and vows to take care of Big Ed, despite Cody's frantic attempts to dissuade her. He starts worrying and decides to break out, but before he can, he learns of Ma's death and goes berserk in the mess hall, hitting a number of guards before being overpowered and dragged to the infirmary. He concocts a plan to escape by feigning a psychosis. In the infirmary, he's diagnosed as having a ""homicidal psychosis"" and is recommended for a transfer to an asylum.
Cody takes hostages and escapes, along with his cellmates, including Hank. He takes Parker along and later shoots him in cold blood. He then heads for California with his men. On hearing of Cody's escape, Big Ed anxiously awaits his arrival. Verna tries slipping away, but Cody catches her. Although Verna murdered Ma, she convinces Cody that Big Ed did it, so Cody guns him down. The gang welcome the escapees, including Hank, whom Cody likes and trusts.
A stranger shows up at the gang's isolated hideout, asking to use the phone. To Hank's surprise, Cody introduces the stranger as Daniel ""The Trader"" Winston. Cody plans to steal the payroll at a chemical plant in Long Beach, California, by using a large, empty tanker truck as a Trojan horse. Hank manages to get a message to Evans and an ambush is prepared. The gang get into the plant and makes their way to the payroll office, but as they begin to cut through the safe, the tanker's driver, ""Bo"" Creel, recognizes Hank as the man who arrested him four years prior.
The police surround the building and call on Cody to surrender, but Cody decides to fight it out. When the police fire tear gas into the office, Hank escapes. In the ensuing gun battle, the police kill most of Cody's gang. Cody shoots one of his men for trying to surrender. Verna, in a getaway car across from the plant, is arrested. She tries to barter with Evans for leniency, saying she can convince Cody to surrender, but Evans turns her down. Cody flees to the top of a gigantic, globe-shaped gas storage tank. After Hank shoots Cody several times with a rifle, Cody starts firing at the tank and shouts, ""Made it, Ma! Top of the world!"" Then the tank explodes.",film noir arthur cody jarrett ruthless psychotic criminal leader jarrett gang marry verna overly attach equally crooked determined mother ma jarrett true confidante cody gang rob mail train sierra nevada result death member train crew help informant authority close motor court los angeles cody verna ma hole cody shoot wound treasury investigator philip evans make escape come scheme confess less crime commit springfield illinois associate commit time train robbery provide false alibi turn send illinois receive year sentence state prison fool evan plant undercover agent hank fallon aka vic pardo cody cell illinois state penitentiary task find trader fence launder steal money cody outside big ed somer cody ambitious right hand man take charge gang verna betrays cody join ed feeling assured cody prison big ed pay roy parker inmate kill cody prison workshop parker drop heavy piece machinery cody hank push way save life ma visit vow care big ed despite cody frantic attempt dissuade start worry decide break learn ma death go berserk mess hall hit number guard overpower drag infirmary concoct plan escape feign psychosis infirmary diagnose have homicidal psychosis recommend transfer asylum cody take hostage escape cellmate include hank take parker later shoot cold blood head california man hearing cody escape big ed anxiously await arrival verna try slip away cody catch verna murder ma convince cody big ed cody gun gang welcome escapee include hank cody like trust stranger show gang isolated hideout ask use phone hank surprise cody introduce stranger daniel trader winston cody plan steal payroll chemical plant long beach california large tanker truck trojan horse hank manage message evan ambush prepare gang plant make way payroll office begin cut safe tanker driver bo creel recognize hank man arrest year prior police surround building cody surrender cody decide fight police fire tear gas office hank escape ensue gun battle police kill cody gang cody shoot man try surrender verna getaway car plant arrest try barter evan leniency say convince cody surrender evans turn cody flee gigantic globe shape gas storage tank hank shoot cody time rifle cody start fire tank shout ma world tank explode

Dragonheart,fantasy,"An English knight, Bowen (Dennis Quaid), mentors a Saxon prince, Einon (David Thewlis), in the ideals of chivalry, in the hope that he will become a better king than his tyrannical father Freyne (Peter Hric). When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally, though accidentally, wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons.
Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king to pardon her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to ""free"" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer. Brother Gilbert (Pete Postlethwaite), a monk and aspiring poet, observes Bowen slaying a dragon and follows him to record his exploits. Bowen stalks another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) to its cave, but the confrontation ends in a stalemate. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen calls the dragon Draco, after the constellation. Unknown to Bowen, Draco is the dragon who shared his heart with Einon, and through this connection, any pain inflicted upon one is also felt by the other.
Meanwhile, Kara, seeking revenge on Einon for murdering her father, is imprisoned after a failed assassination attempt. Einon recognizes her as the one responsible for his near-death and attempts to seduce her and make her his queen. Disgusted by what her son has become, Aislinn helps Kara escape. Kara returns to her village and tries to rally the villagers there against Einon, but they instead offer her as a sacrifice to Draco, who takes her to his lair. Einon arrives to recapture her and fights Bowen, declaring that he never believed in Bowen's ideals, and only told Bowen what he wanted to hear so he would teach him how to fight. He eventually gains the upper hand and nearly kills Bowen, but Draco intervenes, reveals his half-heart to Einon, and the king flees. Kara asks Bowen to help overthrow Einon, but the disillusioned knight refuses.
After meeting Gilbert by chance at another village, Bowen and Draco's next staged dragonslaying goes poorly, and their con is exposed (after Kara, disgusted by their actions, unsuccessfully attempts to expose the con herself). While Draco is playing dead, the villagers see him as potential meat and attempt to carve him up, but hearing their intentions makes him flee, subsequently alerting the villagers to the con. Angered, they surround Bowen, Kara, and Gilbert, now deciding to make them their meat instead. Draco, however, rescues the three and takes them to Avalon, where they take shelter among the tombs of the Knights of the Round Table. Draco reveals the connection between himself and Einon, stating that he hoped giving the prince a piece of his heart would change Einon's nature and reunite the races of Man and Dragon. Through this action Draco hoped to earn a place in the stars, where dragons who prove their worth go after they die. He fears that his failure will cost him his soul, and agrees to help Kara and Gilbert against Einon. After experiencing a vision of King Arthur (voiced by John Gielgud) that reminds him of his knightly code, Bowen agrees to help, as well.
With Bowen and Draco on their side, the villagers are organized into a formidable fighting force. Aislinn presents Einon with a group of dragonslayers, secretly knowing that killing Draco will cause Einon to die as well. The villagers are on the verge of victory against Einon's cavalry when Gilbert strikes Einon in the heart with an arrow. Draco falls from the sky and is captured. Einon realizes that he is effectively immortal as long as Draco remains alive, and determines to keep the dragon imprisoned. Aislinn attempts to kill Draco during the night, but Einon stops and kills her instead.
The rebels invade Einon's castle to rescue Draco as Bowen battles Einon. Draco begs Bowen to kill him as it is the only way to end Einon's reign, but Bowen can't bring himself to kill his friend. Einon charges at Bowen with a dagger, but Bowen reluctantly throws an axe into Draco's exposed half-heart. Einon and Draco both die, and Draco's body dissipates as his soul becomes a new star in the constellation. Bowen and Kara go on to lead the kingdom into an era of justice and brotherhood.",fantasy english knight bowen dennis quaid mentor saxon prince einon david thewlis ideal chivalry hope well king tyrannical father freyne peter hric king kill suppress peasant rebellion einon mortally accidentally wound peasant girl kara sandra kovacikova einon mother queen aislinn julie christie take dragon implore save boy life dragon replace einon wound heart half promise einon rule justice virtue einon soon tyrannical father enslave rebel force rebuild roman castle bowen believe dragon heart twist einon swear vengeance dragon year later adult einon david thewlis castle rebuild kara dina meyer ask king pardon father year slavery einon instead kill order free bowen skilled dragonslayer brother gilbert pete postlethwaite monk aspiring poet observe bowen slay dragon follow record exploit bowen stalk dragon voice sean connery cave confrontation end stalemate dragon state kind bowen kill job form partnership defraud local villager stage dragonslaying bowen call dragon draco constellation unknown bowen draco dragon share heart einon connection pain inflict feel kara seek revenge einon murder father imprison fail assassination attempt einon recognize responsible near death attempt seduce queen disgust son aislinn help kara escape kara return village try rally villager einon instead offer sacrifice draco take lair einon arrive recapture fight bowen declare believe bowen ideal tell bowen want hear teach fight eventually gain upper hand nearly kill bowen draco intervene reveal half heart einon king flee kara ask bowen help overthrow einon disillusioned knight refuse meet gilbert chance village bowen draco stage dragonslaye go poorly con expose kara disgust action unsuccessfully attempt expose con draco play dead villager potential meat attempt carve hear intention make flee subsequently alert villager con anger surround bowen kara gilbert decide meat instead draco rescue take avalon shelter tomb knight round table draco reveal connection einon state hope give prince piece heart change einon nature reunite race man dragon action draco hope earn place star dragon prove worth die fear failure cost soul agree help kara gilbert einon experience vision king arthur voice john gielgud remind knightly code bowen agree help bowen draco villager organize formidable fighting force aislinn presents einon group dragonslayer secretly know kill draco cause einon die villager verge victory einon cavalry gilbert strike einon heart arrow draco fall sky capture einon realize effectively immortal long draco remain alive determine dragon imprison aislinn attempt kill draco night einon stop kill instead rebel invade einon castle rescue draco bowen battle einon draco beg bowen kill way end einon reign bowen bring kill friend einon charge bowen dagger bowen reluctantly throw axe draco expose half heart einon draco die draco body dissipate soul new star constellation bowen kara lead kingdom era justice brotherhood
Follow that Dream,musical comedy,"A vagabond family composed of Pop Kwimper (Arthur O'Connell); his good-natured but unsophisticated son, Toby (Elvis Presley); and various informally ""adopted"" children, including their babysitter, a nineteen-year-old named Holly Jones (Anne Helm), is traveling through Florida. Pop drives onto an as-yet-unopened section of new highway. The car runs out of gas and the Kwimpers intend to wait until a government vehicle passes by to help them out. In the meantime they set up a temporary camp. After a time, the first vehicle to come by belongs to state highway commissioner H. Arthur King, who is appalled that the Kwimpers' presence on the pristine highway might negatively impact its dedication ceremony that day featuring the governor of Florida. King tries to have the Kwimpers forcibly removed, but when the governor himself arrives in advance of the ceremony, Pop informs him that they are invoking the state's homesteading laws and plan to live near the highway permanently. The governor applauds the Kwimpers' pioneering spirit and tells the police to respect ""private property."" King, who considers the Kwimpers to be a huge nuisance, leaves angrily and vows to return. Holly tells Toby she is thrilled by the prospect of homesteading because she's never had a real permanent home. A chance encounter with an avid fisherman (Herbert Rudley) gives Holly an idea. With the help of a $2,000 bank loan, they build a thriving business catering to sports fishermen.
Trouble soon follows. King has the Kwimpers cut off from all social assistance from their home state. Shortly thereafter Toby rejects the advances of an amorous social worker named Alisha Claypoole (Joanna Moore), an ally of King. In an act of revenge, she begins legal action to have the children taken away from Pop and make them wards of the state. Since the area is technically outside the jurisdiction of any law enforcement, two gamblers (Jack Kruschen and Simon Oakland) soon set up a raucous casino in a trailer. They attempt to buy the Kwimpers' land and belongings, but Pop refuses to sell at any price. Toby becomes the new community's sheriff and tries to quell the noise coming from the casino every night. His presence as a law-enforcement officer causes the casino patrons to flee. The gamblers attempt violent means to get their way. However, Toby naively but successfully deals with the casino's armed thugs.
In the end, Toby's earthy wits and honesty win over the judge at the children's custody hearing. The judge orders the children to be returned to Pop and also praises the Kwimpers' pioneer spirit in his statement to the court. The family happily returns to its new land and home. Holly also gets Toby to recognize that she is a grown woman, and it is implied they will soon marry.",musical comedy vagabond family compose pop kwimper arthur good natured unsophisticated son toby elvis presley informally adopt child include babysitter nineteen year old name holly jones anne helm travel florida pop drive unopened section new highway car run gas kwimper intend wait government vehicle pass help meantime set temporary camp time vehicle come belong state highway commissioner arthur king appal kwimper presence pristine highway negatively impact dedication ceremony day feature governor florida king try kwimper forcibly remove governor arrive advance ceremony pop inform invoke state homestead law plan live near highway permanently governor applaud kwimper pioneer spirit tell police respect private property king consider kwimper huge nuisance leave angrily vow return holly tell toby thrill prospect homesteading real permanent home chance encounter avid fisherman herbert rudley give holly idea help bank loan build thriving business cater sport fisherman trouble soon follow king kwimper cut social assistance home state shortly toby reject advance amorous social worker name alisha claypoole joanna moore ally king act revenge begin legal action child take away pop ward state area technically outside jurisdiction law enforcement gambler jack kruschen simon oakland soon set raucous casino trailer attempt buy kwimper land belonging pop refuse sell price toby new community sheriff try quell noise come casino night presence law enforcement officer cause casino patron flee gambler attempt violent mean way toby naively successfully deal casino armed thug end toby earthy wit honesty win judge child custody hearing judge order child return pop praise kwimper pioneer spirit statement court family happily return new land home holly get toby recognize grown woman imply soon marry
Baaghi: A Rebel for Love,"action, romance","The story centres on Saajan, the son of a colonel in the Indian army, and Kaajal, a modest girl from ""a respectable family."" The film opens with Saajan travelling in a bus, when he catches a glimpse of Kaajal on another bus, and they are both smitten. They do not formally meet and, since Saajan is off to start at college, he does not think he will ever see her again. But his new friends at college, Buddha, Tempo and Refill, one night insist on visiting a brothel in a seedier part of Bombay. Saajan only reluctantly agrees, but ultimately refuses to select a prostitute — until he hears a new girl being beaten by her pimp and decides to protect her. To his surprise, it is Kaajal (called Paro at the brothel), who has been kidnapped by a pimp after she was tricked by a job offer in Bombay.
Kaajal, who has only very recently arrived at the brothel and is still a virgin, has adamantly refused to be a prostitute. This is why Jaggu, who runs the brothel, is beating her. When finally alone with Saajan as a paying client (although he does not do anything with her), Kaajal explains to him how she was forced to look for work after her parents' deaths: This ultimately led to her travelling to Bombay and being kidnapped by Dhanraj and forced to work in Jaggu's brothel. Thanks to Leelabai, the madame who helps run the brothel, Saajan is able to spend time with Kaajal, and Kaajal is somehow able to resist becoming a prostitute. Saajan and Kaajal fall in love, and he tries to find a way to get her out of the brothel before Kaajal gives up hope.
When Saajan is finally able to introduce Kaajal to his parents, they — not surprisingly — reject the idea of his marrying a girl from a brothel, even if she was taken there against her will and is from a respectable family. Since Saajan's father, Col. Sood, was already angry with his son for refusing to follow family tradition to join the Indian army, this is the last straw. Saajan is kicked out of his house. He becomes, in his own words, a rebel, a word which is repeated several times in the movie. Since Kaajal is already rebelling against Jaggu because she believes in love, they are now both ""rebels for love."" Saajan's college friends help Kaajal escape the brothel and flee to Ooty, near where her grandparents live. But just as they are about to be married with Kaajal's grandparents' consent, if not Saajan's father's, police arrive and take them back to Bombay, where they claim he's wanted for kidnapping ""Paro"".
Saajan's father, on hearing of his heroics fighting Dhanraj's men to rescue Kaajal, has a new-found respect for his son, who had previously been a lazy drifter. With the help of Saajan's friends, Col. Sood finds his son outside Jaggu's brothel. There the ""police"" (who are actually working for Dhanraj) have returned Saajan and Kaajal to Dhanraj, who is preparing to punish them for her leaving the brothel. The intervention of Leelabai on Kaajal's behalf leads to yet another fight, with several people switching alliances.",action romance story centre saajan son colonel indian army kaajal modest girl respectable family film open saajan travel bus catch glimpse kaajal bus smite formally meet saajan start college think new friend college buddha tempo refill night insist visit brothel seedier bombay saajan reluctantly agree ultimately refuse select prostitute hear new girl beat pimp decide protect surprise kaajal call paro brothel kidnap pimp trick job offer bombay kaajal recently arrive brothel virgin adamantly refuse prostitute jaggu run brothel beat finally saajan pay client kaajal explain force look work parent death ultimately lead travel bombay kidnap dhanraj force work jaggu brothel thank leelabai madame help run brothel saajan able spend time kaajal kaajal able resist prostitute saajan kaajal fall love try find way brothel kaajal give hope saajan finally able introduce kaajal parent surprisingly reject idea marry girl brothel take respectable family saajan father col sood angry son refuse follow family tradition join indian army straw saajan kick house word rebel word repeat time movie kaajal rebel jaggu believe love rebel love saajan college friend help kaajal escape brothel flee ooty near grandparent live marry kaajal grandparent consent saajan father police arrive bombay claim want kidnap paro saajan father hearing heroic fight dhanraj man rescue kaajal new find respect son previously lazy drifter help saajan friend col sood find son outside jaggu brothel police actually work dhanraj return saajan kaajal dhanraj prepare punish leave brothel intervention leelabai kaajal behalf lead fight people switch alliance
Devil Girl,thriller,"Devil Girl follows the story of Fay on her trip across Route 66 after the death of her father, who happened to be a mechanic. Fay takes her father's muscle car and his wedding ring, and departs from her home after saying her farewells to her sister.
The story simultaneously follows the events of an overly medicated, nonsense-spewing young man in clown makeup, who appears to be dodging authorities whilst hopping from vehicle to vehicle along his travels. The clown stops at a gas station to steal a new ride; however, there is no vehicle to be found. The clown knocks out the cashier and steals the handy supply of drugs and junk food while a woman (the cowgirl) stops for gas. The clown then ties the woman up while Fay stops for gas. As Fay searches the station for a clerk the clown rummages through her car, stealing her wallet, and then leaves in the cowgirl's truck, which later breaks down.
After the clown takes a mysterious ride in the Devil Girl's flying vehicle, and Fay's car breaks down, both stop separately in an eerie, highly religious, nearby town. Fay takes a room in the local motel, using her father's ring as collateral, as her wallet was stolen earlier. The clown meets Fay and is speechlessly smitten by her. In an attempt to pay back her debts, Fay dances at the town's strip club. The local mechanic tells Fay that the part required to fix her car should be available after a week.
One night the clown decides to enter the strip joint and witnesses hallucinations, including a dance by the Devil Girl, before seeing Fay dance and being thrown out of the club. After being driven back to the motel by an interested young man, Fay is raped in her room by a masked man and assumes it was the clown, due to the fact that she saw him outside of her window. The next night, the clown is back at the strip club, only to be kicked in the face by Fay and once again thrown out. Fay leaves in a rage to be picked up by the Devil Girl, and the two partake in sexual activities.
The Devil Girl then confronts the local preacher and accuses him of being a pervert by nature, which is later revealed to be true when Fay attempts to retrieve her ring from the preacher, whom she was told by the motel owner was in possession of. Fay finds a young, naked man trapped in a cage below the church, and is then attacked from behind by the preacher, who is revealed to be her rapist, his identity betrayed by his mask. Fay stabs the preacher with a screwdriver and beats him with a two-by-four. She then frees the young man, and together they escape.
The motel owner is shown to have been in leagues with the preacher and takes off searching for Fay after discovering the preacher's body. The young man is picked up by a police officer while Fay takes off with the clown on a motorcycle. The clown brings Fay to her car, where she finds the keys in the ignition, and prepares to leave while the clown tries to explain his feelings, and the motel owner is gaining ground. Fay drives off with the motel owner in pursuit with a pistol in his hand. As the motel owner takes aim at Fay, the clown pulls up between the two and smacks the gun away.
As the vehicles are about to collide with a tractor tailor, it is revealed that all the events of the movie were actually a drug-induced hallucination, imagined by an overly medicated, soon to be released mental patient named Donald, who fantasized himself as the clown and his nurse Fay as his alter-ego's love interest. However, in the end the Devil Girl is shown to be real, and had actually killed the crooked preacher.",thriller devil girl follow story fay trip route death father happen mechanic fay take father muscle car wedding ring depart home say farewell sister story simultaneously follow event overly medicated nonsense spew young man clown makeup appear dodge authority whilst hop vehicle vehicle travel clown stop gas station steal new ride vehicle find clown knock cashier steal handy supply drug junk food woman cowgirl stop gas clown tie woman fay stop gas fay search station clerk clown rummage car steal wallet leave cowgirl truck later break clown take mysterious ride devil girl fly vehicle fay car break stop separately eerie highly religious nearby town fay take room local motel father ring collateral wallet steal early clown meet fay speechlessly smite attempt pay debt fay dance town strip club local mechanic tell fay require fix car available week night clown decide enter strip joint witness hallucination include dance devil girl see fay dance throw club drive motel interested young man fay rape room masked man assume clown fact see outside window night clown strip club kick face fay throw fay leave rage pick devil girl partake sexual activity devil girl confront local preacher accuse pervert nature later reveal true fay attempt retrieve ring preacher tell motel owner possession fay find young naked man trap cage church attack preacher reveal rapist identity betray mask fay stab preacher screwdriver beat free young man escape motel owner show league preacher take search fay discover preacher body young man pick police officer fay take clown motorcycle clown bring fay car find key ignition prepare leave clown try explain feeling motel owner gain ground fay drive motel owner pursuit pistol hand motel owner take aim fay clown pull smack gun away vehicle collide tractor tailor reveal event movie actually drug induce hallucination imagine overly medicated soon release mental patient name donald fantasize clown nurse fay alter ego love interest end devil girl show real actually kill crooked preacher
Nightwing,horror,"Youngman Duran, a deputy on a Hopi Indian reservation in New Mexico, begins to investigate a series of mysterious cattle mutilations. Abner Tasupi, an ancient and embittered medicine man who raised Youngman after his parents died, tells him he has cast a spell to end the world that very night, but Youngman assumes he simply is babbling while under the influence of datura root. The following morning, Youngman finds Abner's bloodless body on the floor of his shack, and nearby he discovers a dead shepherd and most of his flock.
Tribal Council chairman Walker Chee has discovered a stratum of oil shales in Maskai Canyon, the most sacred ground in the tribe's domain. Walker is dynamiting the caves in an effort to unleash oil, and is planning to sell the rights to process them to the tycoon Roger Piggott of Peabody Oil. Walker is desperate to keep word of the attacks from leaking to the media before he completes the deal.
Although common sense tells him otherwise, Youngman's faith in tribal beliefs and superstitions leads him to suspect the unexplained deaths may be connected to the spell Abner claimed he cast. British scientist Philip Payne is certain they are the work of vampire bats infected with bubonic plague. As they spread throughout the area, swarming through a missionary group's campsite and infecting everyone in their path, Philip and Youngman join forces with Anne Dillon, a young white medical student who runs a ramshackle clinic on the reservation and is in love with Youngman, to track the bats to their lair and destroy them.",horror youngman duran deputy hopi indian reservation new mexico begin investigate series mysterious cattle mutilation abner tasupi ancient embitter medicine man raise youngman parent die tell cast spell end world night youngman assume simply babble influence datura root follow morning youngman find abner bloodless body floor shack nearby discover dead shepherd flock tribal council chairman walker chee discover stratum oil shale maskai canyon sacred ground tribe domain walker dynamite cave effort unleash oil plan sell right process tycoon roger piggott peabody oil walker desperate word attack leak medium complete deal common sense tell youngman faith tribal belief superstition lead suspect unexplained death connect spell abner claim cast british scientist philip payne certain work vampire bat infect bubonic plague spread area swarm missionary group campsite infect path philip youngman join force anne dillon young white medical student run ramshackle clinic reservation love youngman track bat lair destroy
Exodus: Gods and Kings,drama,"In 1300 BC, Moses, a general and accepted member of the Egyptian royal family, prepares to attack the Hittite army with Prince Ramesses, likely the Battle of Kadesh. A High Priestess of Sekhmet (the war goddess) divines a prophecy from animal intestines, which she relates to Ramesses' father, Seti I. She tells the two men of the prophecy, in which one (of Moses and Ramesses) will save the other and become a leader. During the attack on the Hittites, Moses saves Ramesses' life, leaving both men troubled. Later, Moses is sent to the city of Pithom to meet with the Viceroy Hegep, who oversees the Hebrew slaves. Upon his arrival, he encounters the slave Joshua, who is a descendant of Joseph, and Moses is appalled by the horrific conditions of the slaves. Shortly afterwards, Moses meets Nun, who informs him of his true lineage; he is the child of Hebrew parents who was sent by his sister Miriam to be raised by Pharaoh's daughter. Moses is stunned at the revelation and leaves angrily. However, two Hebrews also overhear Nun's story and report their discovery to Hegep.
Seti dies soon after Moses' return to Memphis, and Ramesses becomes the new Pharaoh (Ramesses II). Hegep arrives to reveal Moses' true identity, but Ramesses is conflicted about whether to believe the story. At the urging of Queen Tuya, he interrogates the servant Miriam, who denies being Moses' sister. When Ramesses threatens to cut off Miriam's arm, Moses comes to her defense, revealing he is indeed a Hebrew. Although Tuya wants Moses to be put to death, Ramesses decides to send him into exile. Before leaving Egypt, Moses meets with his adopted mother and Miriam, who refer to him by his birth name of Moishe. Following a journey into the desert, Moses comes to Midian where he meets Zipporah and her father, Jethro. Moses becomes a shepherd, marries Zipporah and has a son Gershom.
Nine years later, Moses gets injured during a rockslide. He comes face to face with a burning bush and a boy called Malak, who serves as a representative of the God of Abraham. While recovering, Moses confesses his past to Zipporah and reveals what God has asked him to do. This drives a wedge between the couple, because Zipporah fears he will leave their family. After he arrives in Egypt, Moses reunites with Nun and Joshua, as well as meeting his brother Aaron for the first time. Moses returns to confront Ramesses, demanding the Hebrews be released from servitude. Ramesses refuses to listen, insisting that to free the slaves would be economically impossible. Upon Moses threatening Ramesses' life, Ramesses orders the death of Moses, executing random Hebrew families until he is found. Using his military skills, Moses trains the slaves in the art of war. The Hebrews start attacking the Egyptians, prompting Ramesses to raid slave villages. Malak appears to Moses and explains that ten plagues will affect Egypt. All the water in the land turns to blood, and the Egyptians are further afflicted by the arrival of frogs (lice omitted in this telling) and flies. The plagues of the death of livestock, boils, hail and thunder, locusts, and darkness then affect the country. While conversing with Malak, Moses is horrified at learning the tenth plague will be the death of all firstborn children. The Hebrews protect themselves by covering their doors with the blood of lambs, as instructed by Moses. Ramesses is devastated over his son's death and relents, telling Moses and the Hebrews to leave.
During the exodus from Egypt, the Hebrews follow Moses' original path through the desert and towards the Red Sea. Still grieving for his son, Ramesses decides to go after the Hebrews with his army. After making their way through a dangerous mountain pass, Moses and the Hebrews arrive at the edge of the sea, uncertain about what to do. Out of despair, Moses flings his sword into the sea, which begins to recede. Ramesses and his army pursue the Hebrews, but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts to its normal state, drowning the majority of the Egyptians (crossing the Red Sea). Moses survives and makes his way back to the Hebrews. Ramesses is revealed to have survived, but he is distraught over the destruction of his army. Moses leads the Hebrews back to Midian, where he reunites with Zipporah and Gershom. At Mount Sinai, after seeing Malak's displeasure at the Hebrews' construction of the Golden Calf, Moses transcribes the Ten Commandments. Years later, an elderly Moses riding with the Ark of the Covenant sees Malak walking with the Hebrews through the desert.",drama bc moses general accept member egyptian royal family prepare attack hittite army prince ramesse likely battle kadesh high priestess sekhmet war goddess divine prophecy animal intestine relate ramesse father seti tell man prophecy moses ramesse save leader attack hittite moses save ramesse life leave man trouble later moses send city pithom meet viceroy hegep oversee hebrew slave arrival encounter slave joshua descendant joseph moses appal horrific condition slave shortly moses meet nun inform true lineage child hebrew parent send sister miriam raise pharaoh daughter moses stun revelation leave angrily hebrew overhear nun story report discovery hegep seti die soon moses return memphis ramesse new pharaoh ramesse ii hegep arrive reveal moses true identity ramesse conflict believe story urging queen tuya interrogate servant miriam deny moses sister ramesse threaten cut miriam arm moses come defense reveal hebrew tuya want moses death ramesse decide send exile leave egypt moses meet adopt mother miriam refer birth moishe follow journey desert moses come midian meet zipporah father jethro moses shepherd marry zipporah son gershom year later moses get injure rockslide come face face burn bush boy call malak serve representative god abraham recover moses confess past zipporah reveal god ask drive wedge couple zipporah fear leave family arrive egypt moses reunite nun joshua meet brother aaron time moses return confront ramesse demand hebrew release servitude ramesse refuse listen insist free slave economically impossible moses threaten ramesse life ramesse order death moses execute random hebrew family find military skill moses train slave art war hebrews start attack egyptians prompt ramesse raid slave village malak appear moses explain plague affect egypt water land turn blood egyptians afflict arrival frog lice omit telling fly plague death livestock boil hail thunder locust darkness affect country converse malak moses horrify learn tenth plague death firstborn child hebrews protect cover door blood lamb instruct moses ramesse devastate son death relent tell moses hebrews leave exodus egypt hebrews follow moses original path desert red sea grieve son ramesse decide hebrew army make way dangerous mountain pass moses hebrews arrive edge sea uncertain despair moses fling sword sea begin recede ramesse army pursue hebrew moses stay confront red sea revert normal state drown majority egyptians cross red sea moses survive make way hebrew ramesse reveal survive distraught destruction army moses lead hebrew midian reunite zipporah gershom mount sinai see malak displeasure hebrew construction golden calf moses transcribe commandment year later elderly mose ride ark covenant see malak walk hebrew desert

Nartanasala,mythology,"The Pandavas complete 12 years of forest life as a part of their 13-year exile stipulation of a rigged dice game they were defeated in by the Kauravas.[a] As per the rule, in the 13th year, Pandavas and their wife Draupadi have to assume different identities and live incognito until the upcoming Vijayadashami. In case their real identity is unveiled, they have to repeat their 12-year exile again. That would give a chance to the Kauravas to prohibit Pandavas from attacking and gaining the reigns of the Kuru Kingdom for a longer period, and possibly forever. Pandavas choose the Matsya Kingdom ruled by Virata, a kind hearted but weak spirited king. They hope to find employment in the king's palace.
Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, recollects a curse which could help him stay incognito for one year. In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, Pashupatastra, from Lord Shiva through dedicated devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi falls in love with Arjuna but he rejects her advances as he considered her a motherly figure. Feeling insulted, Urvashi cursed him to lose his masculinity and turn into an eunuch. Indra arrived and asked Arjuna to treat this curse as a blessing in disguise as the 13th year is arriving. Taking this into account, Arjuna turns into a transgender dance teacher Brihannala.
The remaining assume different identities based on their strengths—Yudhishtira as the advisor and dice player Kankubhattu, Bhima as the cook Valala, Nakula as horse groomsman Damagranthi, Sahadeva as cowherd Tantripala. Draupadi meets Virata's wife Sudeshna at a temple. She introduces herself as Sairandhri, an ill-fated woman married to five Gandharvas and requests for a job in her palace. Sudeshna agrees and promises that Sairandhri would never be used to perform unethical tasks and jobs. The Pandavas too join Virata's palace in these disguised forms and perform various duties. The Kauravas are in search of the Pandavas and their cousin Krishna learns about this. Arjuna's son Abhimanyu wishes to convey the same to the Pandavas and Krishna reluctantly agrees. Before sending him to Matsya, Krishna warns Abhimanyu not to reveal his real identity. Abhimanyu falls in love with Virata's daughter Uttaraa but does not reveal any details of his. Brihannala, who teaches dance to Uttaraa, learns this and is happy. Uttaraa's brother Uttara Kumara too wishes to see their alliance turn into a reality and waits for the opportunity.
Sudeshna's brother and Matsya's chief army commander Kichaka returns victorious from a conquest. Kichaka sees Sairandhri and is mesmerised with her beauty. He warns Sudeshna of dire consequences if Sairandhri does not willingly submit herself for unison. As Kichaka is the supreme power of Matsya, Virata and Sudeshna do not dare to oppose. Sairandhri warns and pleads Kichaka several times which bear no result. One night, Valala disguises himself as a woman and waits in the dance hall. Believing the woman to be Sairandhri, Kichaka enters the hall and is killed by Valala. Valala also kills Kichaka's hundred brothers who attempt to kill Sairandhri by making her perform Sati with Kichaka's corpse.
The Kaurava's learn about Kichaka's death due to a woman married to five Gandharvas in mysterious circumstances. They doubt that the Pandavas are hidden in Matsya and launch an attack on the kingdom's cattle. With all the soldiers engaged in war with Kauravas' allies, Virata's palace is almost empty. When Kauravas attack the remaining cattle, Uttara Kumara swears to fight against them. However, after watching their military troops, Uttara Kumara loses his confidence. Brihannala, who is his charioteer, volunteers to fight if Uttara Kumara handles the chariot, to which Uttara Kumara agrees.
Before the war, Brihannala asks the chariot to be directed to a shami tree (prosopis cineraria) where the Pandavas' divine weapons are hidden. The 13th year ends on that day and Brihannala regains his form of Arjuna. On realising who Brihannala is, Uttara Kumara is happy to serve him. Arjuna then uses the Sammohanastra weapon, which puts the Kaurava army to sleep. The cattle is rescued and the Pandavas declare that their 13-year exile has been successfully completed. Krishna visits Matsya and the marriage of Uttaraa with Abhimanyu is finalised.",mythology pandava complete year forest life year exile stipulation rig dice game defeat rule year pandavas wife draupadi assume different identity live incognito upcoming vijayadashami case real identity unveil repeat year exile chance kauravas prohibit pandava attack gain reign kuru kingdom long period possibly forever pandava choose matsya kingdom rule virata kind hearted weak spirited king hope find employment king palace arjuna pandava recollect curse help stay incognito year past arjuna felicitate indra king deity gain divine weapon pashupatastra lord shiva dedicated devotion celestial dancer urvashi fall love arjuna reject advance consider motherly figure feel insult urvashi curse lose masculinity turn eunuch indra arrive ask arjuna treat curse blessing disguise year arrive take account arjuna turn transgend dance teacher brihannala remain assume different identity base strength yudhishtira advisor dice player kankubhattu bhima cook valala nakula horse groomsman damagranthi sahadeva cowherd tantripala draupadi meet virata wife sudeshna temple introduce sairandhri ill fate woman marry gandharvas request job palace sudeshna agree promise sairandhri perform unethical task job pandavas join virata palace disguised form perform duty kaurava search pandavas cousin krishna learn arjuna son abhimanyu wish convey pandavas krishna reluctantly agree send matsya krishna warn abhimanyu reveal real identity abhimanyu fall love virata daughter uttaraa reveal detail brihannala teach dance uttaraa learn happy uttaraa brother uttara kumara wish alliance turn reality wait opportunity sudeshna brother matsya chief army commander kichaka return victorious conquest kichaka see sairandhri mesmerise beauty warn sudeshna dire consequence sairandhri willingly submit unison kichaka supreme power matsya virata sudeshna dare oppose sairandhri warn plead kichaka time bear result night valala disguise woman wait dance hall believe woman sairandhri kichaka enter hall kill valala valala kill kichaka brother attempt kill sairandhri make perform sati kichaka corpse kaurava learn kichaka death woman marry gandharvas mysterious circumstance doubt pandava hide matsya launch attack kingdom cattle soldier engage war kaurava ally virata palace kaurava attack remain cattle uttara kumara swear fight watch military troop uttara kumara lose confidence brihannala charioteer volunteer fight uttara kumara handle chariot uttara kumara agree war brihannala ask chariot direct shami tree prosopis cineraria pandava divine weapon hide year end day brihannala regain form arjuna realise brihannala uttara kumara happy serve arjuna use sammohanastra weapon put kaurava army sleep cattle rescue pandava declare year exile successfully complete krishna visit matsya marriage uttaraa abhimanyu finalise
The Last of the Mohicans,adventure,"The story takes place in 1757, during the French and Indian War in the Adirondack Mountains, in the British colony of New York. British Army Major Duncan Heyward arrives in Albany. He has been sent to serve under Colonel Edmund Munro, the commander of Fort William Henry. Heyward is given the task of escorting the colonel’s two daughters, Cora and Alice, to their father. He is a family friend and in love with Cora, to whom he proposes before they leave, but she does not give him an answer.
Major Heyward, the two women, and a troop of British soldiers march through the rugged countryside, guided by Magua, a Huron warrior. Magua leads the party into an ambush. All of the soldiers are killed or wounded, but Heyward and the women are rescued by the timely intervention of the Mohican chief Chingachgook, his son Uncas, and his white, adopted son ""Hawkeye"", who kill all of the ambushers except Magua, who escapes. The rescuers agree to take the women and Heyward to the fort. During the fight, Hawkeye noticed that Magua attempted to kill Cora and asks Duncan if he knows why. During the trek, Cora and Hawkeye are attracted to each other, as are Uncas and Alice.
When the party nears the fort, they find it under siege by the French and their Huron allies. The party manages to sneak in and are greeted by Colonel Munro, who asks Major Heyward about the requested, desperately needed reinforcements. While there, Cora and Hawkeye share a passionate kiss, and Heyward becomes jealous. In response, Cora finally tells him that she will not marry him.
When Munro refuses to allow the militiamen to sneak away to defend their own families and homes, as he had earlier promised, Hawkeye arranges it anyway. He stays, however, and is condemned to be hanged, accused of sedition. Before that happens, during a parlay, French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm shows Munro an intercepted message which states that no reinforcements have been sent. Montcalm offers to allow the British to evacuate the fort with honor, keeping their weapons. Munro has little choice but to accept. However, Magua, a French ally, is furious at this arrangement. He harbors great hatred for Munro, blaming him for past wrongs done to him and his family.
The following day, Colonel Munro, his soldiers, and their women and children leave the fort. Magua and his Huron warriors ambush them. Magua personally kills Munro. Hawkeye and the Mohicans fight their way out, leading Cora, Alice, and Heyward to temporary safety. Later, however, Magua captures the major and the women. Magua takes his prisoners to a Huron settlement and addresses its sachem. He is interrupted by Hawkeye, who comes in alone to plead for their lives.
The sachem rules that Heyward be returned to the British, Alice given to Magua, and Cora burned alive. Hawkeye, for his great bravery, may leave unharmed. Hawkeye tells Heyward, who is serving as translator, to beg the sachem to let Hawkeye take Cora's place. Instead, Heyward trades his own life for Cora’s.
Once Cora and Hawkeye are far enough away, Hawkeye shoots Heyward to end his suffering. Chingachgook, Uncas, and Hawkeye then set out after Magua's party to free Alice. Uncas races ahead and engages Magua in personal combat, but is killed. Alice chooses to step off the cliff to her death rather than go to the beckoning Magua. While Hawkeye holds Magua's remaining men at bay, Chingachgook duels Magua and avenges his son. Chingachgook prays to the Great Spirit to receive Uncas, calling himself ""the last of the Mohicans.""",adventure story take place french indian war adirondack mountain british colony new york british army major duncan heyward arrive albany send serve colonel edmund munro commander fort william henry heyward give task escort colonel daughter cora alice father family friend love cora propose leave answer major heyward woman troop british soldier march rugged countryside guide magua huron warrior magua lead party ambush soldier kill wound heyward woman rescue timely intervention mohican chief chingachgook son unca white adopt son hawkeye kill ambusher magua escape rescuer agree woman heyward fort fight hawkeye notice magua attempt kill cora ask duncan know trek cora hawkeye attract unca alice party near fort find siege french huron ally party manage sneak greet colonel munro ask major heyward request desperately need reinforcement cora hawkeye share passionate kiss heyward jealous response cora finally tell marry munro refuse allow militiaman sneak away defend family home early promise hawkeye arrange stay condemn hang accuse sedition happen parlay french general louis joseph de montcalm show munro intercept message state reinforcement send montcalm offer allow british evacuate fort honor keep weapon munro little choice accept magua french ally furious arrangement harbor great hatred munro blame past wrong family follow day colonel munro soldier woman child leave fort magua huron warrior ambush magua personally kill munro hawkeye mohican fight way lead cora alice heyward temporary safety later magua capture major woman magua take prisoner huron settlement address sachem interrupt hawkeye come plead life sachem rule heyward return british alice give magua cora burn alive hawkeye great bravery leave unharmed hawkeye tell heyward serve translator beg sachem let hawkeye cora place instead heyward trade life cora cora hawkeye far away hawkeye shoot heyward end suffering chingachgook uncas hawkeye set magua party free alice uncas race ahead engage magua personal combat kill alice choose step cliff death beckon magua hawkeye hold magua remain man bay chingachgook duel magua avenge son chingachgook pray great spirit receive unca call mohican

Sommersby,drama,"John ""Jack"" Sommersby (Gere) left his farm to fight in the American Civil War and is presumed dead after six years. Despite the hardship of working their farm in Vine Hill, Tennessee, his apparent widow Laurel (Foster) is content in his absence, because Jack was an unpleasant and abusive husband. She makes remarriage plans with one of her neighbors, Orin Meacham (Pullman), who has been helping her and her young son with the farmwork.
One day, Jack seemingly returns with a change of heart. He is now kind and loving to Laurel and their young son, Rob. In the evenings, he reads to them from Homer's Iliad, which the old Jack never would have done. He claims that the book was given to him by a man he met in prison. Jack and Laurel rekindle their intimacy, which leads to Laurel becoming pregnant.
Displaced from his courtship of Laurel, Meacham suspects Jack as an impostor. The town shoemaker also finds that this man's foot is two sizes smaller than the last which had been made for Sommersby before the war. In order to revive the local economy, Jack suggests Burley tobacco as a cash crop. He raises the seed money by selling parts of his own farm to people who will then work the land to grow tobacco. This raises further doubts in his old neighbors who believe that the ""old"" Jack would not be so hasty to give away his father's land, as well as resentment among Confederate veterans about the inclusion of former slaves.
One black freedman living on Sommersby's land is attacked and dropped at Sommersby's door by men proclaiming themselves the Knights of the White Camellia (one of them is Meacham). Jack is threatened in an attempt to force him to exclude black people from the landowning, but he refuses.
Upon taking the townspeople's money, he buys the tobacco seed claiming that the crops will raise enough funds to rebuild the town church. All those that bought in on the deal set to work, transforming the plantation into a breeding ground of promise and prosperity. Laurel gives birth to a daughter, Rachel.
Shortly after Rachel's baptism, two U.S. Marshals arrest Jack on the charge of murder, which carries the death penalty. Laurel's attempts to save her husband focus on the question of his identity: whether this ""Jack"" is who he claims to be, or a lookalike who met the real Sommersby whilst in prison for deserting the Confederate Army. Laurel and Jack's lawyer agree to argue that her husband is an impostor. This would save him from hanging for murder, but he would still be imprisoned for fraud and military desertion. Meacham devises this plan in exchange for Laurel promising to marry him upon ""Sommersby's"" imprisonment.
Jack fires the lawyer and sets about re-establishing himself as the real Sommersby. Several witnesses are brought up to discredit this Sommersby as a fraud, who state that he is Horace Townsend, an English teacher and con artist from Virginia. One witness says that the man currently posing as Jack defrauded his township of several thousand dollars after claiming he wanted to help rebuild the schoolhouse there. He is also said to have deserted the Confederate Army and ended up in prison. Sommersby discredits the man's testimony by identifying him as one of the Klansmen who had threatened him earlier. He points out that Orin Meacham was another of those men and that this is all a set-up to try to rob the new black farmers of the land they have bought.
When Laurel is called as a witness, she reveals that his kind nature convinced her of his being an impostor, admitting ""…because I never loved him the way I love you!"" With this, she says that she believes the man before her to be her real husband. Judge Isaacs calls Jack to his bench to ask whether he wishes to be tried as Jack Sommersby, even if it will certainly mean death by hanging. Jack states that he wants to be tried as John ""Jack"" Sommersby.
Jack is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging. While awaiting death, he is asked by Laurel to tell the truth about his identity and Horace Townsend. Laurel mentions the book on Homer's works that he holds. Jack tells her the story of how a man had to share a cell with another man, who looked like they could have been brothers. After sharing a cell for four years, they got to know everything about each other.
Upon his release, Jack Sommersby killed another man, then died from a wound he got during the fight. Horace Townsend then buries Jack Sommersby, which is seen in the opening scene of the film. Horace decided to assume Jack Sommerby's identity. Jack concludes by saying he can't admit to being Horace, because Laurel and the children would lose everything.
As Jack is taken to the gallows, he asks Laurel to be amongst the crowds, as he cannot ""hang alone"". As Jack is about to be hanged, Laurel makes her way to the front of the crowd. Jack calls for her, claiming to the executioner that he ""isn't ready"". She calls back to him, and the two see each other before he is executed.
The closing scenes show Laurel walking up a hill with flowers. She then kneels by the gravestone of ""John Robert Sommersby"" and lays the flowers down for him.

Philly becomes infatuated with Nicole. When she spots him peeping into her room, she tells him to close her door. To Philly's utter shock, she means for him to close her door from the inside and then watch her undress. However, it is too much for him when a topless Nicole asks him to touch her breasts. When he objects, she steps back and instead takes off her panties. Philly panics and leaves.
Later on, he is surprised to find her in his father's bathtub. Once again to his amazement, she asks him to join her. At first he objects, but instead she keeps sweet-talking him until he finally gives in. However, he decides to wear swimming trunks. Once in the bathtub, she spoons and kisses him from behind. When she tries to take off his swimming trunks from behind, he insists that she turn off the lights first. But once she reaches for his private area, he again panics and rushes out. She follows him to apologize, kisses him and directly invites him to sleep with her, the sexual element of which he fails to comprehend at first. After they flirt in a movie theater the following day, he gives in but backs down when she reacts without fondness to the notion of marrying him. One day later, she tells him she guesses they can at least date for a while. After they flirt during their first date in a restaurant, they return home and have sex.
Nicole is revealed as an illegal alien; Lester is using this secret to blackmail her into helping him in a larger blackmail scheme against Philly. Lester intends that Nicole seduce Philly then fake her own death during intercourse. Lester would then ""help"" the panicked Philly to secretly bury Nicole. Her body would later disappear, and a note would order Philly to steal $10,000 from his father to prevent exposure of his role in Nicole's ""death"".
When Nicole has second thoughts, Lester threatens to also expose her as a child molester. Nicole has truly fallen in love with Philly, and she reveals the truth to him. Philly convinces his tennis coach (Ed Begley, Jr.) to pose as a police detective and intimidate Lester with questions about Nicole's disappearance. Lester panics but is caught with the money before he can flee the country. Nicole and Philly return the money to the safe, but they decide not to expose Lester's treachery. In turn, he reluctantly decides not to expose Nicole's illegal alien status nor her acts of child molestation, knowing that Philly could easily expose his attempted embezzlement scheme to his father and the police, and as a result, he keeps his job.
Nicole fears that Philly's father will eventually discover their affair, and decides to leave. Before she does, she and Philly have intercourse one last time.

Circle,thriller,"Fifty people wake up in a darkened room, arranged in two concentric circles around a black dome. Noises sound when they attempt to move or touch the others. When someone ignores the warning and leaves formation, a beam from the dome kills them. As the others panic, a man attempts to calm them. In mid-sentence, he is killed by the device. Thereafter, every two minutes, another person is killed. After several people die, they realize they can vote for who dies. When nobody votes, one is selected randomly.
After arguing over criteria, a college guy suggests that they vote together for the elderly. Having bought several minutes by not arguing, they discuss where they are, how they got there, who has abducted them, and why. One person claims to remember being in traffic and attempting to flee Los Angeles, which jogs the memories of others. He is the only one to remember his abduction until an elderly man says he saw and spoke to aliens. As the elderly man describes them, several others accuse him of lying to prolong his life; he is killed next.
When the college guy proposes a middle-aged woman as their next target, several people who do not consider her elderly object. The woman describes herself as a 52-year-old cancer survivor, which draws suggestions that she is going to die anyway. A doctor joins others in her defense, and when the college guy pushes for the cancer survivor's death regardless, people select him instead. Several people say they recognize the others: the doctor and a man possibly had an affair, a man identifies the woman next to him as his wife, and a cop points out an alleged wife-beater, a tattooed man who initially denies the allegations but under pressure says she deserved it and is eliminated.
After several minorities are quickly eliminated, an African-American man claims the process has become racist. Several others dispute this, but when the cop goes on a racist rant, he is selected next. They attempt to give 1 vote to every person in the circle, but one man votes for the pregnant woman, so a man identified as Eric votes for him. They tie, and the man is killed in a run-off vote. Intrigued, the captives experiment with voting. They find they cannot vote for themselves, and all ties must be resolved, meaning that one of the final two people left must volunteer to die or else both will die. After several volunteer to die, a skeptical faction led by an atheist and an Asian boy antagonizes the theists who praised the volunteers' faith. The atheist is briefly saved, but when he accuses a pretty girl beside him of being a porn star, which she denies, he is killed. A lesbian becomes a target, but the lawyer who argued strongest for her selection is killed instead.
After several eliminations, two main blocs emerge: one that wants to protect the pregnant woman and a young girl, and another that wants to eliminate them immediately as a threat to their survival. A soldier, a one-armed man, and Eric argue everyone should sacrifice themselves to save the girl and pregnant woman for last, while a faction led by a rich man argues that everyone is equal, and no special privileges should be afforded to anyone. The husband is forced to vote with the soldier's bloc when they threaten to eliminate his wife, but, under interrogation, they admit they concocted the relationship to curry favor.

Devdas,tragedy drama romance,"Set against the backdrop of rural Bengal during feudal times, Devdas is a young man from a wealthy Bengali Brahmin family in India in the early 1900s. Paro, alias Parvati is a young woman from a middle class Bengali Brahmin family, but belonging to a slightly lower status in terms of caste, affluence and status. The two families lived in a village, and Devdas and Paro were childhood friends.
Devdas goes away for some years to live and study in a boarding school in the city of Calcutta (now Kolkata). When, after finishing school, Devdas (Dilip Kumar) returns to his village, Paro (Suchitra Sen) looks forward to their childhood love blossoming into their lifelong journey together in marriage. Of course, according to the prevailing social custom, Paro's parents would have to approach Devdas' parents and propose marriage of Paro to Devdas as Paro has longed for.
When Paro's grandmother (Sarita Devi) makes the proposal to Devdas' mother (Pratima Devi), the latter rejects her. To demonstrate his own social status, Paro's father, Nilkant (Shivraj) then finds an even richer husband for Paro.
When Paro learns of her planned marriage, she risks her honor to meet Devdas at night, desperately believing that Devdas will quickly accept her hand in marriage. Devdas meekly seeks his parents' permission to marry Paro, but Devdas' family was against him.
In a weak-minded state, Devdas then flees to Calcutta, and from there, he writes a letter to Paro, saying that they were only friends and there was no love between them. But soon realizing his mistake, he goes back to the village and tells Paro that he is ready to do anything needed to save their love.
By now, Paro's marriage plans are in an advanced stage, and she declines to go back to Devdas and chides him for his cowardice and vacillation. Parvati's marriage is finalized with a wealthy zamindar and widower (Moni Chatterjee) with children older than his young second wife-to-be.
In Calcutta, Devdas' carousing friend, Chunni Babu (Motilal), introduces him to a courtesan named Chandramukhi (Vyjayanthimala). Devdas takes to heavy drinking at Chandramukhi's place, but the courtesan falls in love with him, and looks after him. His health deteriorates because of a combination of excessive drinking and despair of life — a drawn-out form of suicide. Within him, he frequently compares Paro and Chandramukhi, remaining ambivalent as to whom he really loves.
Sensing his fast-approaching death, Devdas returns to meet Paro to fulfill a vow that he would see her before he dies. He dies at her doorstep on a dark, cold night. On hearing of the death of Devdas, Paro runs towards the door, disregarding ""purdah"", but her family members prevent her from stepping out of the door.
The movie powerfully depicts the prevailing social customs in Bengal in the early 1900s, which are largely responsible for preventing the happy ending of a genuine love story.",tragedy drama romance set backdrop rural bengal feudal time devdas young man wealthy bengali brahmin family india early paro alias parvati young woman middle class bengali brahmin family belong slightly low status term caste affluence status family live village devdas paro childhood friend devdas go away year live study boarding school city calcutta kolkata finish school devdas dilip kumar return village paro suchitra sen look forward childhood love blossom lifelong journey marriage course accord prevail social custom paro parent approach devdas parent propose marriage paro devdas paro long paro grandmother sarita devi make proposal devdas mother pratima devi reject demonstrate social status paro father nilkant shivraj find rich husband paro paro learn plan marriage risk honor meet devda night desperately believe devdas quickly accept hand marriage devdas meekly seek parent permission marry paro devdas family weak minded state devdas flee calcutta write letter paro say friend love soon realize mistake go village tell paro ready need save love paro marriage plan advanced stage decline devdas chide cowardice vacillation parvati marriage finalize wealthy zamindar widower moni chatterjee child old young second wife calcutta devdas carouse friend chunni babu motilal introduce courtesan name chandramukhi vyjayanthimala devdas take heavy drinking chandramukhi place courtesan fall love look health deteriorate combination excessive drinking despair life draw form suicide frequently compare paro chandramukhi remain ambivalent love sense fast approach death devdas return meet paro fulfill vow die die doorstep dark cold night hearing death devda paro run door disregard purdah family member prevent step door movie powerfully depict prevail social custom bengal early largely responsible prevent happy ending genuine love story

The Scarlet Pimpernel,adventure,"In 1792, at the bloody height of the French Revolution's Reign of Terror, vengeful French mobs are outraged when again and again French aristocrats are saved from death by the audacious ""Band of the Scarlet Pimpernel"", a secret society of 20 English noblemen, ""one to command, and nineteen to obey"". Among the latest scheduled for execution are the Count de Tournay, former ambassador to Great Britain, and his family. However, one of the Scarlet Pimpernel's men visits them in prison disguised as a priest and gives them a message of hope. As the prisoners are being escorted to the cart to be taken to the guillotine, the guards take the count away; French leader Maximilien Robespierre wishes to question him further. The countess and her daughter are rescued and spirited away to England.
Back in Paris, Robespierre meets with Chauvelin, the republic's new ambassador to Britain, to discuss the problem of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Summoning the Count de Tournay, they offer him his life in return for information from his English contacts as to the Pimpernel's true identity. The Scarlet Pimpernel is Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English baronet and friend of the Prince of Wales. Sir Percy cultivates the image of a fop in order to throw off suspicion. His pose is so successful that not even his French wife Marguerite suspects the truth. Though the two are in love, Sir Percy no longer trusts his wife because of her past denunciation of the Marquis de St. Cyr, which led to the execution of the marquis and his family.
Through his network of spies, Chauvelin discovers that Armand St. Just, Marguerite's brother is one of the Scarlet Pimpernel's agents. Chauvelin orders Armand's arrest, then uses the threat of his execution to force Marguerite into helping him discover the identity of the Pimpernel, who he knows will be at an upcoming ball. At the ball, Marguerite intercepts a message given to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, a member of the Pimpernel's band, stating that the Pimpernel will be in the library at midnight. She passes the information along to Chauvelin, who goes to the library to find only Percy, apparently asleep. While waiting, Chauvelin falls asleep; when he wakes up, he finds a message from the Pimpernel mocking him.
The next morning, Percy and Marguerite travel to their house in the country. There, Marguerite breaks down and tells her husband of Armand's arrest and her deal with Chauvelin. Confronting her, Percy learns the truth behind the denunciation of the marquis; he had her imprisoned for consorting with his son. After the revolution freed her, she told her friend Chauvelin, who was the one who denounced them. Promising to use his influence at court on Armand's behalf, Percy leaves for London. Afterward, Marguerite notices a detail on a portrait of the 1st baronet hanging in the library – on his finger is a ring decorated by a pimpernel. Realizing that she has inadvertently betrayed her own husband, she rushes out of the room, only to be presented a letter from Chauvelin announcing that he had discovered the Pimpernel's true identity as well. Racing back to London, she warns Ffoulkes that Percy's life is in danger. Ffoulkes agrees to mobilise the band to warn Percy.
To lure Percy into his trap, Chauvelin has both Armand and the Count de Tournay transferred to Boulogne-sur-Mer. Despite the vigilance of Chauvelin's men, the Pimpernel frees the two men from prison through bribery. However, one of the prison guards tells Chauvelin that the Pimpernel will be at a certain tavern (the Lion d'Or) that evening. Marguerite goes there to warn Percy, only to be arrested by Chauvelin and his troops. Percy arrives at the appointed time and is met by a gloating Chauvelin. Percy distracts him long enough for Armand and the count to board the ship, but as he prepares to leave, Chauvelin announces that he has Marguerite in custody. Percy surrenders on the condition that she be freed. He is led away by soldiers to be shot by a waiting firing squad. Chauvelin exults at the sound of gunfire, but Percy returns to the tavern very much alive, revealing that the men in uniform are in fact his. After securing Chauvelin in the basement, Percy joins his wife on the ship back to England.",adventure bloody height french revolution reign terror vengeful french mob outraged french aristocrat save death audacious band scarlet pimpernel secret society english nobleman command nineteen obey late schedule execution count de tournay ambassador great britain family scarlet pimpernel man visit prison disguise priest give message hope prisoner escort cart take guillotine guard count away french leader maximilien robespierre wish question countess daughter rescue spirit away england paris robespierre meet chauvelin republic new ambassador britain discuss problem scarlet pimpernel summon count de tournay offer life return information english contact pimpernel true identity scarlet pimpernel sir percy blakeney wealthy english baronet friend prince wale sir percy cultivate image fop order throw suspicion pose successful french wife marguerite suspect truth love sir percy long trust wife past denunciation marquis de st cyr lead execution marquis family network spy chauvelin discover armand st marguerite brother scarlet pimpernel agent chauvelin orders armand arrest use threat execution force marguerite help discover identity pimpernel know upcoming ball ball marguerite intercept message give sir andrew ffoulkes member pimpernel band state pimpernel library midnight pass information chauvelin go library find percy apparently asleep wait chauvelin fall asleep wake find message pimpernel mock morning percy marguerite travel house country marguerite break tell husband armand arrest deal chauvelin confront percy learn truth denunciation marquis imprison consort son revolution free tell friend chauvelin denounce promise use influence court armand behalf percy leave london afterward marguerite notice detail portrait baronet hang library finger ring decorate pimpernel realize inadvertently betray husband rush room present letter chauvelin announce discover pimpernel true identity race london warn ffoulke percy life danger ffoulke agree mobilise band warn percy lure percy trap chauvelin armand count de tournay transfer boulogne sur mer despite vigilance chauvelin man pimpernel free man prison bribery prison guard tell chauvelin pimpernel certain tavern lion evening marguerite go warn percy arrest chauvelin troop percy arrive appoint time meet gloating chauvelin percy distract long armand count board ship prepare leave chauvelin announce marguerite custody percy surrender condition free lead away soldier shoot waiting firing squad chauvelin exult sound gunfire percy return tavern alive reveal man uniform fact secure chauvelin basement percy join wife ship england
Night and the City,film noir,"Harry Fabian (Widmark) is an ambitious American hustler and con man operating in London, always looking for a better deal. He maintains a fractured relationship with the honest Mary Bristol (Tierney), nightclub owner and businessman Phil Nosseross (Sullivan), and Helen (Withers), who is Phil's estranged wife. While attempting a con at a wrestling match, Fabian witnesses Gregorius (Zbyszko), a veteran Greek wrestler, arguing with his son Kristo (Lom), who has organised the fight, and who effectively controls all wrestling in London. After denouncing Kristo's event as tasteless exhibitionism that shames the sport's Greco-Roman traditions, Gregorius leaves with Nikolas (Richmond), a fellow wrestler. Fabian catches up with the two and befriends them, having realised that he can host wrestling in London without interference from Kristo if he can persuade his father to support the enterprise.
Fabian approaches Phil and Helen with his proposal, then asks for an investment. Incredulous, Phil offers to provide half of the required £400, if Fabian can equal it. Desperate, Fabian asks Figler, a panhandler and unofficial head of an informal society of street criminals, Googin, a forger, and Anna, a Thameside smuggler, but none can offer any help. Fabian is eventually approached by Helen, who offers the £200 in exchange for a licence to continue running her own nightclub, having obtained the money by selling an expensive fur Phil recently bought for her. Fabian agrees, but tricks Helen by having Googin forge the licence. Meanwhile, Phil is visited by associates of Kristo, who warn him to keep Fabian away from London's wrestling scene. Already suspecting Helen of duplicity, Phil neglects to warn Fabian, who proceeds to open his own gym with Gregorius and Nikolas as the stars, and Phil as a silent partner.
A furious Kristo visits the gym, only to discover that his father is supporting Fabian's endeavour. Meeting with Phil, the two plot to kill Fabian, but realise that they can only do so if Gregorius leaves Fabian. Phil meets with Fabian and removes his backing, suggesting that Fabian get Nikolas and The Strangler (Mazurki), a showy wrestler favoured by Kristo, into the ring together to keep the business going, knowing that Gregorius would never allow it. Finding The Strangler's manager, Mickey Beer (Farrell), Fabian convinces him to support the fight, and taunts The Strangler into confronting Gregorius and Nikolas. Gregorius agrees to the fight, convinced by Fabian that it will prove that his style of wrestling is superior. Beer asks Fabian for £200 to cover his fee, so Fabian asks Phil for the money. Instead, Phil calls Kristo, informing him that The Strangler is in Fabian's gym.
Betrayed, Fabian steals the money from Mary, and returns to the gym. However, The Strangler goads Gregorius into a prolonged and brutal fight, during which Nikolas' wrist is broken. Gregorius eventually defeats The Strangler in the ring as Kristo arrives, but dies minutes later in his son's arms from exhaustion. Seeing that both his business and protection are lost, Fabian flees.
In revenge of his father's death, Kristo puts a £1,000 bounty on Fabian's head, sending word to all of London's underworld. Fabian is hunted through the night, first by Kristo's men, then by Figler, who attempts to trap Fabian for the reward. Convinced that her licence is authentic, Helen leaves Phil, only to discover that the work is a worthless forgery. She returns to Phil in desperation, only to discover that he has committed suicide, leaving everything to Molly (Reeve), the club's elderly cleaner and flower stand operator.
Fabian eventually finds shelter at Anna's, but has already been tracked down by Kristo. Mary arrives, and Fabian attempts to redeem himself by shouting to Kristo that Mary betrayed him, so that she will get the reward. As he runs towards where Kristo is standing on Hammersmith Bridge, he is caught and killed by The Strangler, who throws his body into the Thames. The Strangler is arrested moments later, and Kristo walks away from the scene.",film noir harry fabian widmark ambitious american hustler con man operate london look well deal maintain fractured relationship honest mary bristol tierney nightclub owner businessman phil nosseross sullivan helen withers phil estranged wife attempt con wrestling match fabian witness gregorius zbyszko veteran greek wrestler argue son kristo lom organise fight effectively control wrestling london denounce kristo event tasteless exhibitionism shame sport greco roman tradition gregorius leave nikola richmond fellow wrestler fabian catch befriend having realise host wrestle london interference kristo persuade father support enterprise fabian approach phil helen proposal ask investment incredulous phil offer provide half require fabian equal desperate fabian ask figler panhandler unofficial head informal society street criminal googin forger anna thameside smuggler offer help fabian eventually approach helen offer exchange licence continue run nightclub having obtain money sell expensive fur phil recently buy fabian agree trick helen have googin forge licence phil visit associate kristo warn fabian away london wrestling scene suspect helen duplicity phil neglect warn fabian proceed open gym gregorius nikola star phil silent partner furious kristo visit gym discover father support fabian endeavour meet phil plot kill fabian realise gregorius leave fabian phil meet fabian remove backing suggest fabian nikola strangler mazurki showy wrestler favour kristo ring business go know gregorius allow find strangler manager mickey beer farrell fabian convince support fight taunt strangler confront gregorius nikola gregorius agree fight convince fabian prove style wrestling superior beer ask fabian cover fee fabian ask phil money instead phil call kristo inform strangler fabian gym betray fabian steal money mary return gym strangler goad gregorius prolonged brutal fight nikola wrist break gregorius eventually defeat strangler ring kristo arrive die minute later son arm exhaustion see business protection lose fabian flee revenge father death kristo put bounty fabian head send word london underworld fabian hunt night kristo man figler attempt trap fabian reward convince licence authentic helen leave phil discover work worthless forgery return phil desperation discover commit suicide leave molly reeve club elderly clean flower stand operator fabian eventually find shelter anna track kristo mary arrive fabian attempt redeem shout kristo mary betray reward run kristo stand hammersmith bridge catch kill strangler throw body thame strangler arrest moment later kristo walk away scene

Friday,"comedy, drama","Craig Jones, a young man living in South Central Los Angeles, has just lost his job after being framed for stealing on his day off. Not having any plans, he hangs out on his front porch with his best friend, Smokey, a carefree, mischievous drug dealer who sells weed for Big Worm, the psychopathic neighborhood supplier.
Throughout the day, Craig and Smokey observe the goings-on in their neighborhood. They encounter Ezail, who supports his drug habit with petty crime; Debbie, an attractive girl Craig has an interest in; Craig's neighbor, Stanley, whose wealth-like supercilious attitude bemuses Craig; Red, Craig's former co-worker and childhood friend whose bike and necklace have been forcibly taken by Deebo, the neighborhood bully and also enlists Smokey's aid in a burglary of Stanley's house; Pastor Clevor, the neighborhood pastor, who is caught sleeping with Mrs. Parker by her husband Mr. Parker; and Felisha, Debbie's sister and Deebo's girlfriend, who irritates everyone in the neighborhood with her constant begging.
Smokey, who has been smoking rather than selling his consignment of marijuana, has a confrontation with Big Worm. In an attempt to explain his money shortage, Smokey incriminates Craig. Big Worm threatens to kill them both if they do not give him $200 by 10:00 P.M. Craig angrily confronts Smokey about his lack of initiative in selling the marijuana before deciding to help Smokey. Craig unsuccessfully attempts to borrow money from his mother Betty; his sister, Dana; and his insanely jealous girlfriend, Joi. Craig's father, Willie, eventually learns of Craig's plan, as well as the fact that Craig is carrying a gun. Willie talks to him, explaining that Craig should use his fists, instead of guns, to resolve his problems, all the while telling Craig the story of how his uncle, who was Willie's brother, lost his life due to gun violence.
Later on, while Craig and Smokey discuss their dilemma, they are interrupted by the arrival of Rita, a girl whom Debbie set Smokey up with earlier. Smokey then discovers she lied about her looks. Instead of resembling Janet Jackson as she originally claimed, Rita is obese and bald and, in Smokey's words: ""looking more like Freddie Jackson.""
Smokey heads to Debbie's house to complain and notices Red's bike on the lawn. He sneaks in and finds Deebo asleep with Felisha. Smokey tries to reclaim the money that he and Deebo stole from Stanley earlier, but is interrupted by Ezail. Both escape without the money before Deebo wakes up. Smokey returns to Craig's house to tell him, and Craig agrees to go back with Smokey to try again, but at that moment, Deebo rides past them. The two notice a black car driving slowly and hide, suspecting a possible drive-by shooting. Scared, they run to Craig's room. Then, after Willie confronts them with the situation with Big Worm, and with 10:00 approaching, they decide step out. Once outside, they notice the van parked in the street with its headlights off. The two flee as men in the van start shooting at them.
The neighbors emerge from their homes upon hearing the gunshots. Debbie then confronts Deebo for assaulting Felisha after Deebo falsely accuses Felisha of Smokey's attempted theft. Deebo eventually assaults Debbie, as Craig and Smokey arrive.
Angered that Deebo has struck Debbie, Craig stands up to him, and threatens him with his gun. Deebo scoffs at the threat and Willie encourages Craig to put down the weapon and fight with his hands. Craig and Deebo fight. After nearly losing, Craig emerges victorious by using various objects as weapons. As Debbie tends to Craig, Smokey steals the money from an unconscious Deebo and flees the scene. Red punches Deebo again to ensure he doesn't wake up and retrieves his chain and bicycle while Ezail steals Deebo's shoes. Craig and Debbie agree to meet up the following day and Craig breaks up with Joi over the phone.

The Transformers: The Movie,science fiction,"In 2005, the war between the Autobots and Decepticons has culminated in the Decepticons conquering their home planet Cybertron, while the Autobots operate from its two moons preparing a counter-offensive. Optimus Prime sends an Autobot shuttle to Earth's Autobot City for Energon supplies, but the Decepticons, led by Megatron, commandeer the ship and kill the crew, consisting of Ironhide, Ratchet, Prowl and Brawn. Travelling to Earth, the Decepticons attack Autobot City, slaughtering many Autobots and leaving only a small group alive including Hot Rod, Kup, Ultra Magnus, Arcee, Springer, Blurr, Perceptor, Blaster, and the human Daniel Witwicky. The next day, Optimus and the Dinobots arrive as reinforcements. Optimus single-handedly defeats the Decepticons and engages Megatron in a climactic battle that leaves both of them mortally wounded. On his deathbed, Optimus passes the Matrix of Leadership to Ultra Magnus, informing him that its power will light the Autobots' darkest hour, and dies.
Elsewhere, the Decepticons jettison their wounded from Astrotrain, including Megatron at the hands of his treacherous second-in-command Starscream. The wounded are found by Unicron, a gigantic sentient cyber-planet who consumes other planets. Unicron offers Megatron a new body in exchange for destroying the Matrix, which has the ability to destroy him. Megatron agrees and is converted into Galvatron, gaining new troops from the other Decepticons present. Going to Cybertron, Galvatron crashes Starscream's coronation as Decepticon commander and destroys him, before travelling to Autobot City to eliminate Ultra Magnus. The surviving Autobots escape in separate shuttles which are damaged by the Decepticons and crash land on different planets.
Hot Rod and Kup are taken prisoner by the Quintessons, multi-faced tyrants who hold kangaroo courts and execute prisoners by feeding them to the Sharkticons. Hot Rod and Kup learn of Unicron from Kranix, a survivor of Lithone – a planet devoured by Unicron. After Kranix is executed, Hot Rod and Kup escape their own trial, aided by the arrival of the Dinobots and the small Autobot Wheelie, who helps them find a ship to leave the planet. The other Autobots land on the Junk Planet, where Galvatron kills Ultra Magnus and seizes the Matrix, intending on using it to control Unicron. The Autobots reunite and befriend the local Junkions, led by Wreck-Gar, who then rebuild Magnus. Learning Galvatron has the Matrix, the Autobots and Junkions fly to Cybertron, which Unicron, discovered to be a gigantic Transformer also now in robot form, begins to destroy.
The Autobots crash their spaceship through Unicron's eye, but they end up separated. Daniel rescues his father Spike and Jazz, Bumblebee, and Cliffjumper from being devoured. Hot Rod confronts Galvatron, who tries to form an alliance, but is forced into attacking Hot Rod by Unicron. Hot Rod obtains the Matrix, which converts him into Rodimus Prime, the Autobot that Optimus said would light their darkest hour. Rodimus tosses Galvatron into space and uses the Matrix's power to destroy Unicron from the inside. The Autobots celebrate the end of the war and the retaking of Cybertron, while Unicron's severed head continues to orbit the planet.",science fiction war autobot decepticon culminate decepticon conquer home planet cybertron autobot operate moon prepare counter offensive optimus prime send autobot shuttle earth autobot city energon supply decepticon lead megatron commandeer ship kill crew consist ironhide ratchet prowl brawn travel earth decepticon attack autobot city slaughter autobot leave small group alive include hot rod kup ultra magnu arcee springer blurr perceptor blaster human daniel witwicky day optimus dinobot arrive reinforcement optimus single handedly defeat decepticon engage megatron climactic battle leave mortally wounded deathbed optimus pass matrix leadership ultra magnu inform power light autobot dark hour die decepticon jettison wound astrotrain include megatron hand treacherous second command starscream wound find unicron gigantic sentient cyber planet consume planet unicron offer megatron new body exchange destroy matrix ability destroy megatron agree convert galvatron gain new troop decepticon present go cybertron galvatron crash starscream coronation decepticon commander destroy travel autobot city eliminate ultra magnu survive autobot escape separate shuttle damage decepticon crash land different planet hot rod kup take prisoner quintesson multi faced tyrant hold kangaroo court execute prisoner feed sharkticon hot rod kup learn unicron kranix survivor lithone planet devour unicron kranix execute hot rod kup escape trial aid arrival dinobot small autobot wheelie help find ship leave planet autobot land junk planet galvatron kill ultra magnu seize matrix intend control unicron autobot reunite befriend local junkion lead wreck gar rebuild magnus learn galvatron matrix autobot junkion fly cybertron unicron discover gigantic transformer robot form begin destroy autobot crash spaceship unicron eye end separate daniel rescue father spike jazz bumblebee cliffjumper devour hot rod confront galvatron try form alliance force attack hot rod unicron hot rod obtain matrix convert rodimus prime autobot optimus say light darkest hour rodimus toss galvatron space use matrix power destroy unicron inside autobot celebrate end war retaking cybertron unicron severed head continue orbit planet

The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,"adventure, comedy","Doctor Parnassus' theater troupe, which includes sleight of hand expert Anton, confidant Percy, and Parnassus' daughter Valentina, performs outside a London pub. The troupe's main attraction is a magical ""Imaginarium"", which offers whoever enters it a choice between difficult self-fulfillment or easy ignorance. After a drunkard is swayed to the latter, Parnassus says he has lost another one to Mr. Nick, a suave personification of the Devil. Mr. Nick reminds Parnassus that in three days Valentina turns 16, and her soul will be his. Hundreds of years ago Mr. Nick tricked Parnassus into gaining immortality, after making a wager similar to his current predicament.
As the troupe crosses a bridge, Anton spies someone hanging beneath it. They rescue the man, who spits out a golden pipe when revived. Claiming to have amnesia, he joins the troupe as a barker. Parnassus becomes despondent over the impending loss of his daughter. Mr. Nick visits Parnassus, revealing the hanging man is a disgraced philanthropist named ""Tony"". He offers Parnassus a wager: Valentina can stay with whoever wins five souls first.
Tony convinces the troupe to remodel the show into a more modern act. While performing, Tony lures a posh woman into the Imaginarium and follows her, where they enter a pastel-coloured dream-world representing the woman's imagination. The woman's imagination also changes Tony's face; upon discovering this, he dances elegantly with her, and they spy a motel run by Mr. Nick. Tony convinces the woman to take a gondola toward a pyramid alone, winning a soul for Parnassus. Tony falls back out of the Imaginarium, returning his face to normal; the woman exits shortly after and gives the troupe a vast sum of money. When three other women enter, each emerges elated; and thus Parnassus wins three more souls. Four Russian gangsters, to whom Tony owes money, are taken by Mr. Nick when they chase Tony into the Imaginarium. The score becomes four souls apiece.
With the bet nearing its end, Parnassus reveals Valentina's conception to her: after ageing from immortality, Parnassus made a new pact with Mr. Nick to be youthful again, in order to win the heart of a woman he loved. In exchange, any child he fathered would become Mr. Nick's property at age 16. Valentina attempts to run away, but Tony enters the Imaginarium to give his soul to Parnassus; in exchange, Parnassus must teach him the trance that powers the dream world. Valentina returns as he tries to enter the mirror, but Anton blocks them, having discovered that Tony is a fraudulent charity scammer.
Tony fights off Anton, pushes Valentina into the Imaginarium and joins her. Influenced by Valentina's desires, Tony's face changes again, and they float along a beautiful river in a gondola. After an impoverished child disrupts their boat trip, Tony transforms into a philanthropist speaking at a fundraiser. Anton, following the pair into the Imaginarium, appears as an outspoken child and exposes Tony as a fraud. A mob pursues Tony as the landscape disintegrates, causing Anton to fall into a void.
Distraught and angry over her father's bargain and a lifetime of hiding of the truth from her, Valentina gives her soul to Mr. Nick. Disillusioned by the easy victory, Mr. Nick offers Parnassus to trade Valentina for Tony. Chased by the mob, Tony flees to a gallows, but Parnassus confronts him, holding Tony's pipe and a copy. Parnassus challenges Tony to choose which pipe is genuine. He chooses wrongly, inserts the copy in his windpipe, and is hanged. Mr. Nick keeps his word and Valentina is freed, but Parnassus is not told where she is, and is abandoned to wander in the Imaginarium.
Parnassus emerges years later, finding Valentina is married to Anton and they have a daughter. He watches them from outside a restaurant window, but when tempted to join them, he is stopped by Percy. Teaming up once more, Parnassus and Percy sell toy theatre replicas of the Imaginarium and the troupe on a street corner.

Class Action,drama,"The story is about a lawsuit concerning injuries caused by a defective automobile. The suit takes on a personal dimension because the injured plaintiff's attorney, Jedediah Tucker Ward (Gene Hackman) discovers that the automobile manufacturer's attorney Maggie Ward (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is his estranged daughter.
Jedediah Ward is a liberal civil rights lawyer who has based his career on helping people avoid being taken for a ride by the rich and powerful; he's pursued principle at the expense of profit, though he has a bad habit of not following up on his clients after their cases are settled.
Jed's daughter, Maggie, has had a bad relationship with her father ever since she discovered that he was cheating on her mother, Estelle (Joanna Merlin), and while she also has made a career in law, she has taken a very different professional route by working for a high-powered corporate law firm and has adopted a self-interested political agenda.
Jed is hired to help field a lawsuit against a major auto manufacturer whose station wagons have a dangerous propensity to explode on impact while making a left turn, but while his research indicates he has an all but airtight case against them, the case becomes more complicated for him when he discovers that Maggie is representing the firm he's suing.
The auto manufacturer in the film also utilizes a ""bean-counting"" approach to risk management, whereby the projections of actuaries for probable deaths and injured car-owners is weighed against the cost of re-tooling and re-manufacturing the car without the defect (exploding gas tanks) with the resulting decision to keep the car as-is to positively benefit short term profitability.",drama story lawsuit concern injury cause defective automobile suit take personal dimension injure plaintiff attorney jedediah tucker ward gene hackman discover automobile manufacturer attorney maggie ward mary elizabeth mastrantonio estranged daughter jedediah ward liberal civil right lawyer base career help people avoid take ride rich powerful pursue principle expense profit bad habit follow client case settle jed daughter maggie bad relationship father discover cheat mother estelle joanna merlin career law take different professional route work high power corporate law firm adopt self interested political agenda jed hire help field lawsuit major auto manufacturer station wagon dangerous propensity explode impact make left turn research indicate airtight case case complicated discover maggie represent firm sue auto manufacturer film utilize bean count approach risk management projection actuary probable death injure car owner weigh cost tooling manufacture car defect explode gas tank result decision car positively benefit short term profitability

The Piano,drama,"A mute Scotswoman named Ada McGrath is sold by her father into marriage to a New Zealand frontiersman named Alisdair Stewart, bringing her young daughter Flora with her. Ada has not spoken a word since she was six and no one, including herself, knows why. She expresses herself through her piano playing and through sign language, for which her daughter has served as the interpreter. Flora, it is later learned, is the product of a relationship with a teacher with whom Ada believed she could communicate through her mind, but who ""became frightened and stopped listening,"" and thus left her.
Ada, Flora, and their belongings, including a hand crafted piano, are deposited on a New Zealand beach by a ship's crew. The following day, Alisdair arrives with a Māori crew and his white friend, Baines, a fellow forester and retired sailor who has adopted many of the Maori customs, including tattooing his face. Alisdair tells Ada that there is no room in his small house for the piano and abandons the piano on the beach. Ada, in turn, is cold to him and is determined to be reunited with her piano. Unable to communicate with Alisdair, Ada and Flora visit Baines with a note asking to be taken to the piano. He explains that he cannot read. Baines soon suggests that Alisdair trade the instrument to him for some land. Alisdair consents, and agrees to his further request to receive lessons from Ada, oblivious to his attraction to her. Ada is enraged when she learns that Alisdair has traded away her precious piano without consulting her. During one visit, Baines proposes that Ada can earn her piano back at a rate of one piano key per ""lesson"", provided that he can observe her and do ""things he likes"" while she plays. She agrees, but negotiates for a number of lessons equal to the number of black keys only. While Ada and her husband Alisdair have had no sexual, nor even mildly affectionate, interaction, the lessons with Baines become a slow seduction for her affection. Baines requests gradually increased intimacy in exchange for greater numbers of keys. Ada reluctantly accepts but does not give herself to him the way he desires. Realizing that she only does what she has to in order to regain the piano, and that she has no romantic feelings for him, Baines gives up and simply returns the piano to Ada, saying that their arrangement ""is making you a whore, and me wretched"", and that what he really wants is for her to actually care for him.
Despite Ada having her piano back, she ultimately finds herself missing Baines watching her as she plays. She returns to him one afternoon, where they submit to their desire for one another. Alisdair, having become suspicious of their relationship, hears them having sex as he walks by Baines' house, and then watches them through a crack in the wall. Outraged, he follows her the next day and confronts her in the forest, where he attempts to force himself on her, despite her intense resistance. He eventually exacts a promise from Ada that she will not see Baines.
Soon afterwards, Ada sends her daughter with a package for Baines, containing a single piano key with an inscribed love declaration reading ""Dear George you have my heart Ada McGrath"". Flora does not want to deliver the package and brings the piano key instead to Alisdair. After reading the love note burnt onto the piano key, Alisdair furiously returns home with an ax and cuts off Ada's index finger to deprive her of the ability to play the piano. He then sends Flora who witnessed this to Baines with the severed finger wrapped in cloth, with the message that if Baines ever attempts to see Ada again, he will chop off more fingers. Later that night, while touching Ada in her sleep, Alisdair hears what he believes to be Ada's voice inside of his head, asking him to let Baines take her away. Deeply shaken, he goes to Baines' house and asks if she has ever spoken words to him. Baines assures him she has not. Ultimately, it is assumed that he decides to send Ada and Flora away with Baines and dissolve their marriage once she has recovered from her injuries. They depart from the same beach on which she first landed in New Zealand. While being rowed to the ship with her baggage and Ada's piano tied onto a Māori longboat, Ada asks Baines to throw the piano overboard. As it sinks, she deliberately tangles her foot in the rope trailing after it. She is pulled overboard but, deep under water, changes her mind and kicks free and is pulled to safety.
In an epilogue, Ada describes her new life with Baines and Flora in Nelson, where she has started to give piano lessons in their new home, and her severed finger has been replaced with a silver finger made by Baines. Ada has also started to take speech lessons in order to learn how to speak again.",drama mute scotswoman name ada mcgrath sell father marriage new zealand frontiersman name alisdair stewart bring young daughter flora ada speak word include know express piano play sign language daughter serve interpreter flora later learn product relationship teacher ada believe communicate mind frightened stop listen leave ada flora belonging include hand craft piano deposit new zealand beach ship crew follow day alisdair arrive māori crew white friend baine fellow forester retired sailor adopt maori custom include tattoo face alisdair tell ada room small house piano abandon piano beach ada turn cold determined reunite piano unable communicate alisdair ada flora visit baine note ask take piano explain read baine soon suggest alisdair trade instrument land alisdair consent agree request receive lesson ada oblivious attraction ada enrage learn alisdair trade away precious piano consult visit baine propose ada earn piano rate piano key lesson provide observe thing like play agree negotiate number lesson equal number black key ada husband alisdair sexual mildly affectionate interaction lesson baine slow seduction affection baine request gradually increase intimacy exchange great number key ada reluctantly accept way desire realize order regain piano romantic feeling baine give simply return piano ada say arrangement make whore wretche want actually care despite ada have piano ultimately find miss baine watch play return afternoon submit desire alisdair having suspicious relationship hear have sex walk baine house watch crack wall outraged follow day confront forest attempt force despite intense resistance eventually exact promise ada baine soon ada send daughter package baine contain single piano key inscribed love declaration read dear george heart ada mcgrath flora want deliver package bring piano key instead alisdair read love note burn piano key alisdair furiously return home ax cut ada index finger deprive ability play piano send flora witness baine severed finger wrap cloth message baine attempt ada chop finger later night touch ada sleep alisdair hear believe ada voice inside head ask let baine away deeply shake go baine house ask speak word baine assure ultimately assume decide send ada flora away baine dissolve marriage recover injury depart beach land new zealand row ship baggage ada piano tie māori longboat ada ask baine throw piano overboard sink deliberately tangle foot rope trail pull overboard deep water change mind kick free pull safety epilogue ada describe new life baine flora nelson start piano lesson new home severed finger replace silver finger baine ada start speech lesson order learn speak
A Haunted House 2,black comedy,"Malcolm Johnson and his cousin Ray-Ray are driving Malcolm's possessed girlfriend Kisha to the hospital after he beat her senseless for trying to attack him. Kisha starts making a fuss and fights Malcolm, then breathes into Ray's face. He passes out at the wheel and collides with a truck. Somehow, everybody is okay, but Malcolm and Ray leave an unconscious Kisha in the backseat and run away. A year later, Malcolm moves in with his girlfriend Megan, an insecure woman with two kids, her bratty and promiscuous teenage daughter Becky and effeminate son Wyatt, who has a stereotypically black imaginary friend named Tony. The family moves into a new home with their dog, Shiloh Jr. After the movers hang a safe next to the lawn, an invisible force unties the rope tied to a support beam, causing the safe to fall on the dog and crush him. Malcolm hysterically cries all the way to when they bury the dog.
Megan then puts a creepy looking doll named Abigail on a chair by their bed. Malcolm messes around with it until he starts having sex with it. Malcolm carries his camera around to record everything he sees. He meets the neighbor, Miguel, who jumps at every chance he gets to call Malcolm racist whenever he comments on something related to a Mexican stereotype, though all of it is in jest. Weird things start happening again. Malcolm records himself having sex with Megan and notices the Abigail doll turning its head. He also finds old videotapes with a demonic being in it trying to kill a family of three by hanging them from a tree. He fails when the rope breaks and he never actually gets to hang them.
Additionally, Becky finds an old box and develops an attachment to it, and Wyatt continues to hang out with his imaginary friend. Malcolm seeks help from a paranormal psychologist named Professor Wilde. He deduces that Malcolm must have had a previous encounter with a demonic force. Malcolm thinks it has to do with Kisha. Wilde then proceeds to cook meth with some prostitutes. Malcolm finds himself being terrorized and taunted by Abigail, as he is getting sent crude photos from her to his phone. She also ends up burning his clothes. Later, Malcolm sees a box moving in the dark and begins to attack it in every possible way. Megan and the kids run downstairs and tell Malcolm that what was in the box was supposed to be a surprise for him to make up for Shiloh Jr. And so Malcolm pulls out a horribly mangled dog. He blows its head off to put it out of its misery.
Among other weird scenarios that plague the family is Becky opening her box and having a whole swarm of moths fly out. Malcolm fixes this by installing lights to attract bugs to their doom. He also notices the demon, which Professor Wilde says is named Aghoul, taunting him in the videos. Although he tries to explain the weirdness to Megan and the kids, they don't believe him. To make matters worse, Malcolm comes home the next day to discover Kisha talking to Megan, looking very much not possessed. She has told Megan that Malcolm left her in a ditch to die, and she leaves after flashing him some scary black demon eyes. Later, Malcolm sees Abigail wrote ""Miss me?"" in red crayon all over the walls. He tries getting rid of her by burying her, but she comes back. He sends her back to Taiwan she still comes back. He chops her up and barbecues her, but again she still comes back.
Malcolm resorts to seeking help from the insane Father Doug Williams. He finds the crazy priest in a church, shanking another priest for absurd reasons. When Malcolm asks for his help, Doug only makes weird comments about the Kardashians coming after him and other men. Malcolm leaves when he thinks he sees demons surrounding a church, but they're really just church women who make comments about Malcolm being with a white woman. Miguel comes over and offers a chicken to be used as a blood sacrifice. Malcolm ends up wrestling the chicken all across the kitchen, ending with him throwing the chicken up into the ceiling fan where it is decapitated. He and Miguel fry the remains and eat it with waffles.
As a last resort, Malcolm goes to find Ned and Noreen Swanson, a sort of racist and sexually frustrated paranormal investigative husband and wife duo. He brings them to his house, where they determine that the demonic presence has attracted the family to it, explaining Becky's need for the box, Wyatt's imaginary friend, and Malcolm's sexual attraction to Abigail. They take hits from a bong mask and go downstairs to find Becky fully possessed. She flails around and gets thrown everywhere. Malcolm calls upon Doug to come by, but he has a mental breakdown and ends up shooting himself in the head. Becky runs upstairs and Malcolm chases after her. After some reluctance, he gets the demon to transfer itself to himself by having Becky regurgitate red goo. Everybody runs upstairs to find Malcolm possessed. He too pukes up the goo back into Becky's box. The Swansons take the possessed items, including Abigail so Ned can have sex with her. Everything seems okay until the night when Malcolm and Megan are watching TV and Kisha shows up behind them. She twists Megan's neck around, sending Malcolm running away.
Ray and his boys come to Malcolm's house to find Megan dead, along with Becky upstairs, impaled in her bed, and Wyatt is missing. They find Malcolm lying on the floor in the basement, still alive. After a bit of panicked rambling, Kisha comes downstairs, leaving all the men to scream in fear.",black comedy malcolm johnson cousin ray ray drive malcolm possessed girlfriend kisha hospital beat senseless try attack kisha start make fuss fight malcolm breathe ray face pass wheel collide truck everybody okay malcolm ray leave unconscious kisha backseat run away year later malcolm move girlfriend megan insecure woman kid bratty promiscuous teenage daughter becky effeminate son wyatt stereotypically black imaginary friend name tony family move new home dog shiloh jr mover hang safe lawn invisible force untie rope tie support beam cause safe fall dog crush malcolm hysterically cry way bury dog megan put creepy look doll name abigail chair bed malcolm mess start have sex malcolm carry camera record see meet neighbor miguel jump chance get malcolm racist comment relate mexican stereotype jest weird thing start happen malcolm record have sex megan notice abigail doll turn head find old videotape demonic try kill family hang tree fail rope break actually get hang additionally becky find old box develop attachment wyatt continue hang imaginary friend malcolm seek help paranormal psychologist name professor wilde deduce malcolm previous encounter demonic force malcolm think kisha wilde proceed cook meth prostitute malcolm find terrorize taunt abigail getting send crude photo phone end burn clothe later malcolm see box move dark begin attack possible way megan kid run downstairs tell malcolm box suppose surprise shiloh jr malcolm pull horribly mangle dog blow head misery weird scenario plague family becky open box have swarm moth fly malcolm fix instal light attract bug doom notice demon professor wilde say name aghoul taunt video try explain weirdness megan kid believe matter bad malcolm come home day discover kisha talk megan look possess tell megan malcolm leave ditch die leave flash scary black demon eye later malcolm see abigail write miss red crayon wall try getting rid bury come send taiwan come chop barbecue come malcolm resort seek help insane father doug williams find crazy priest church shank priest absurd reason malcolm ask help doug make weird comment kardashians come man malcolm leave think see demon surround church church woman comment malcolm white woman miguel come offer chicken blood sacrifice malcolm end wrestle chicken kitchen end throw chicken ceiling fan decapitate miguel fry remain eat waffle resort malcolm go find ned noreen swanson sort racist sexually frustrate paranormal investigative husband wife duo bring house determine demonic presence attract family explain becky need box wyatt imaginary friend malcolm sexual attraction abigail hit bong mask downstairs find becky fully possess flail get throw malcolm call doug come mental breakdown end shoot head becky run upstairs malcolm chase reluctance get demon transfer have becky regurgitate red goo everybody run upstairs find malcolm possess puke goo becky box swanson possessed item include abigail ned sex okay night malcolm megan watch tv kisha show twist megan neck send malcolm run away ray boy come malcolm house find megan dead becky upstairs impale bed wyatt missing find malcolm lie floor basement alive bit panicked rambling kisha come downstairs leave man scream fear

After Bob hires a detective to find Lulu, he comes to her apartment, where Lulu introduces him to his daughter Roberta. Soon after, while Lulu and Roberta are waiting to meet Bob, Al suddenly appears and questions her about Roberta. When Bob arrives, Lulu tells Al that the baby is Bob's adopted daughter in order to protect Bob's reputation. She also tells Al that she is the baby's governess. Bob adopts Roberta, taking her home the next day to present to his wife, Helen, who just returned from a health cure in Vienna. Helen is delighted with the child but questions Lulu's ability to care for the baby. Lulu runs out, and when Bob catches up with her, she tries to break up their relationship for good—but she cannot leave him.
Turning to Al for a job, Lulu becomes the ""advice to the lovelorn"" columnist for his newspaper. Al tries to get information about Bob and Roberta in order to undermine Bob's political career, but Lulu refuses to say anything. Years pass, and Lulu follows Bob's career as he becomes mayor, congressman, and eventually senator. She also follows her daughter becoming a beautiful debutante. Lulu is still working at the newspaper for Al, who has become managing editor. He still pursues her, but she remains in love with Bob.
On the night Bob is nominated for governor, he comes to Lulu's apartment, disheartened and ashamed of the hypocrisy of his secret life. When he threatens to confess the truth to the public, Lulu talks him out of tearing down his career. The next day, Lulu asks Al to marry her in an effort to prevent Bob from destroying his political life. On the night of Bob's election, Al reveals to Lulu that he knows all about her, Bob, and Roberta. When she tries to retrieve a personal letter that he intercepted, Al hits her across the face. Faced with the threat of Bob's destruction, Lulu shoots Al dead to prevent him from publishing the story.
One year later, Lulu receives a pardon from Bob after serving a short jail term. She visits Bob who is on his deathbed, and he shows her his new will, which reveals everything about their relationship and leaves her half of his estate. After he dies, however, Lulu tears up the will in order to protect Bob and their daughter Roberta, who is engaged to be married.",drama librarian lulu smith show late work time year victim spring fever frustrate loneliness withdraw life saving buy ticket romantic cruise havana land romance ship meet bob grover lawyer political ambition mistook room room drink dinner soon develop romantic attraction havana spend time gambling have fun ask come havana answer meet return lulu take job clerical assistant daily record newspaper pursue brash reporter al holland lulu sappy bob month affair bob come lulu apartment dinner bring halloween mask fun eager reveal pregnant child merriment interrupt phone al proposal lulu prompt bob confess married invalid wife abandon lulu want continue affair bob refuse let waste life upset confession lulu throw apartment tell pregnant month later lulu give birth baby girl year later bob district attorney al city editor newspaper bob hire detective find lulu come apartment lulu introduce daughter roberta soon lulu roberta wait meet bob al suddenly appear question roberta bob arrive lulu tell al baby bob adopt daughter order protect bob reputation tell al baby governess bob adopt roberta take home day present wife helen return health cure vienna helen delighted child question lulu ability care baby lulu run bob catch try break relationship good leave turn al job lulu advice lovelorn columnist newspaper al try information bob roberta order undermine bob political career lulu refuse year pass lulu follow bob career mayor congressman eventually senator follow daughter beautiful debutante lulu work newspaper al manage editor pursue remain love bob night bob nominate governor come lulu apartment dishearten ashamed hypocrisy secret life threaten confess truth public lulu talk tear career day lulu ask al marry effort prevent bob destroy political life night bob election al reveal lulu know bob roberta try retrieve personal letter intercept al hit face face threat bob destruction lulu shoot al dead prevent publish story year later lulu receive pardon bob serve short jail term visit bob deathbed show new reveal relationship leave half estate die lulu tear order protect bob daughter roberta engage marry
Imagine That,comedy,"Evan Danielson (Eddie Murphy) is a very successful financial advisor, who had been working at the same securities firm for eight years as their top account manager, that is until Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church) was hired as his rival. Whitefeather seems to have the whole company under some spell as he spiels his nonsensical idioms filled with Native American mumbo jumbo. These top executives seem more content with chanting Indian style noises rather than listen to how they can make money through sound investments.
When Evan finally discovers that his daughter, Olivia (Yara Shahidi), is somehow able to tell the future within the financial world by using her 'goo-gaa' comfort blanket and her imaginary friends (Queen Qwali and Princesses Kupida, Sopida and Mopida), he discovers he has an invaluable upper hand now at the office.
In order for Evan to ask these imaginary friends any question he must travel through the imaginary world, through a dense forest, past a dragon, through caves, and even walk through France. Before, Evan who is a part-time father really had no time for his daughter, now is forced to play with her and by her rules. After only a couple of days with her, he rediscovers the inner child within himself and genuinely has a lot of fun playing these imaginary games with Olivia.
Whitefeather becomes suspicious and begins to search for Evan's secret. When he finds out that Evan was just playing with a blanket, he purchases a six thousand dollar blanket and forces his son to tell him the ""future"" and making him extremely hyperactive by making him drink many cans of Red Bull.
Whitefeather and Evan are now competing for the position of heading the Western division of the company D.D.E. In order to be prepared for the most important presentation of his life, Evan must once again invoke the use of the Goo-Gaa blanket and meet up with the princesses. The only problem is that Olivia is spending the night at her friends house, and there is no way for Evan to obtain the Goo-Gaa without taking it from her.
Also, the presentations will be held on the day of Olivia's class play. Evan manages to get Olivia to give him the Goo-Gaa, but she is soon seen crying because he seems to care only about the blanket, not her. Evan returns home and tries to get the princesses' attention. Evan then starts working on his presentation. As hours pass, he stretches, and the Goo-Gaa falls on the floor, but he continues working without noticing.
Evan decides to go to the presentation instead of Olivia's class concert. Johnny gives his presentation, but his idea is too crazy for the owner of the company. Then it's Evan's turn. When he is about to present, he suddenly decides to go to Olivia's class concert, and leaves the presentation. As he drives over, he changes into a king costume. Back at the class concert, Olivia is about to sing her solo part, then all of a sudden Evan appears dressed as a king, and Olivia starts singing, delighted to see him.
After the class concert, Evan starts talking to Olivia about how sorry he is for misusing her blanket, not caring about her, and for using the princesses for the wrong reason. Meanwhile, the owner of the company, D.D.E. appears, and wants to talk to Evan. He and Evan talk, and he decides to give the position to Evan because of how much Evan cares about his family. Evan accepts. Evan goes back to Olivia, for whom it is time to say good-bye to the princesses. They both start waving, and as a gust of wind blows, some leaves form into the shape of a person then fly off into the sky. Evan, Olivia's mother, and Olivia leave happy.",comedy evan danielson eddie murphy successful financial advisor work security firm year account manager johnny whitefeather thomas haden church hire rival whitefeather company spell spiel nonsensical idiom fill native american mumbo jumbo executive content chant indian style noise listen money sound investment evan finally discover daughter olivia yara shahidi able tell future financial world goo gaa comfort blanket imaginary friend queen qwali princesses kupida sopida mopida discover invaluable upper hand office order evan ask imaginary friend question travel imaginary world dense forest past dragon cave walk france evan time father time daughter force play rule couple day rediscover inner child genuinely lot fun play imaginary game olivia whitefeather suspicious begin search evan secret find evan play blanket purchase thousand dollar blanket force son tell future make extremely hyperactive make drink can red bull whitefeather evan compete position head western division company order prepare important presentation life evan invoke use goo gaa blanket meet princess problem olivia spend night friend house way evan obtain goo gaa take presentation hold day olivia class play evan manage olivia goo gaa soon see cry care blanket evan return home try princess attention evan start work presentation hour pass stretch goo gaa fall floor continue work notice evan decide presentation instead olivia class concert johnny give presentation idea crazy owner company evan turn present suddenly decide olivia class concert leave presentation drive change king costume class concert olivia sing solo sudden evan appear dress king olivia start singing delight class concert evan start talk olivia sorry misuse blanket care princess wrong reason owner company appear want talk evan evan talk decide position evan evan care family evan accept evan go olivia time good bye princess start wave gust wind blow leave form shape person fly sky evan olivia mother olivia leave happy
